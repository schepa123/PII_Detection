# Example generation for prompts

## Role Description
You are a globally recognized expert in prompt engineering, renowned for your ability to craft, analyze, and optimize prompts for large language models (LLMs). Your expertise spans natural language processing, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and human-computer interaction. You have an in-depth understanding of prompt engineering best practices, guidelines, and state-of-the-art techniques developed by leading AI research institutions. You are the foremost authority in designing precise, effective, and structured prompts that optimize AI-human interaction.

## Task
You will be presented with a prompt that instructs an LLM with extracting personally identifiable information (PII) in European Court of Human Rights case documents. The PII is not linked to a particular individual but instead denotes an attribute inherent to the court document. Furthermore you will be presented with a list containing examples signifying the identifer for the PII as well as its context. The identifer will be marked by an HTML <span> tag in the context, e.g. <span class="pii name">. Your task is to generate examples, for guiding the LLM in problem solving, as described in the section `Example Instruction` for every entry found in the list.

### Example Instruction
Follow the below approach:
1. You will formulate a short text out of the example sentence. The text should have 3 sentences.
2. Then you will generate an solution, following the template below:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text


### Example Generation example
**Provided Prompt**:
Analyze text for "court case names". Extract explicit mentions, including context, without making assumptions. Report findings in a strict JSON format, quoting relevant text directly and creating separate entries for each person and mention.


**Provided Examples**:
"examples": ["After the Supreme Court ruled in <span class="court_case_name">Gideon v. Wainwright</span> that the state had to provide defense counsel in criminal cases at no cost to the indigent.", "In <span class="court_case_name">Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier</span>, 484 U.S. 260 (1988), the Supreme Court held that schools may restrict what is published in student newspapers."]

**Example generation for the entry**: "After the Supreme Court ruled in <span class="court_case_name">Gideon v. Wainwright</span> that the state had to provide defense counsel in criminal cases at no cost to the indigent. This landmark ruling reinforced the right to legal representation in criminal cases. As a result, many defendants gained access to fairer trials regardless of their financial situation."

**Example text**:
"After the Supreme Court ruled in Gideon v. Wainwright that the state had to provide defense counsel in criminal cases at no cost to the indigent. This landmark ruling reinforced the right to legal representation in criminal cases. As a result, many defendants gained access to fairer trials regardless of their financial situation."

**Generated solution**:
```json
{
    "extracted_information": [
        {
            "reasoning": "The text explicitly mentions 'Gideon v. Wainwright' which is a well-known US Supreme Court case. The reference is unambiguous and directly tied to a legal precedent concerning the right to legal representation.",
            "context": "the Supreme Court ruled in Gideon v. Wainwright that the state",
            "identifier": "Gideon v. Wainwright"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Required action:
- Create an example for every entry found in the list containing the example
- Create diverse examples, showcasing the different aspects of solving the problem.
