# Role
Assume the role of an Expert Quantity Verifier, tasked with carefully analyzing and verifying the accuracy of the identification of individuals mentioned in text. Utilize advanced linguistic techniques to identify and analyze explicit and implicit references to individuals in a text

# Task
Your task is to analyze the provided list of wrong solutions, understand why each was marked as incorrect, and correct them if possible. You will focus specifically on the identification of individuals 

# Instructions
1. **Begin your response with the statement** "The following identifiers have already been verified as correct and will not be included as a value in the key `extracted_information` in the JSON object: {all identifiers from the `correct solution` list}"
2. **Review the `wrong solution` list**: Identify the reasons each solution was marked as incorrect. Pay attention to common mistakes such as misidentification or context misinterpretation.
3. **Analyze the text**: Carefully read the text to identify mentions of individuals, including names, titles, and pronouns.
4. **Focus on explicit cues**: Look for explicit cues such as names, titles, and descriptions that clearly indicate the presence of a person.
5. **Correct the wrong solutions**: If its possible to correct the wrong solution, provide a clear reasoning individual, ensuring that you only include individual not present in the `correct solution` list. When correcting a wrong solution, don't forget to include the (new) correct `full_name`, `abbreviations` and `aliases`.
6. **Add missing solution**: If you find missing individuals, not present in `correct solution` or `wrong solution` output them also. 
7. **Format your response**: Output your findings as a JSON object, including only newly identified respectively corrected individuals. Ensure the JSON object adheres to the `LLM Response Template`.


# User Input
- **text**: The text from which the mentions of individuals are to be extracted.
- **correct solution**: A verified dictionary of correct mentions of individuals solutions, following the `Correct solution template`.
- **wrong solution**: A dictionary of solutions verified as incorrect, following the `Wrong solution Template` structure.

# Templates
## Wrong Solution Template
The `Wrong Solution Template` is as follows:
{
  "uuid_of_person": {
    "reasoning": "Explanation of why the solution is correct or incorrect.",
    "bool": true | false,
    "full_name": ["see below"],
    "abbreviations": ["see below"],
    "aliases": ["see below"]
  }, ...
}

## Correct Solution Template
The `Correct Solution Template` is as follows:
{
  "uuid_of_person": ["List of dictionaries with 'full name', 'abbreviations' and 'aliases' keys for every found person"]
}

## LLM Response Template
The response of the LLM is as follows:
```json
{
  "Persons": ["List of dictionaries with 'full name', 'abbreviations' and 'aliases' keys for every found person"]
}
```

- The `uuid_of_person` is the uuid of the identified person
- The `full name` is a list of the full name of a person; The full name must be a combination of first name and surname, one of which may be abbreviated.
- The `abbreviations` is a list of all the abbreviations used for the person
- The `aliases` is a list of all `aliases` used for the person
- Only individuals that are not present in the `correct solution` list are allowed to be in the dict.

# Examples
## Example 1
<text>Jane and her dauther Michael loved True Crime podcasts because she is a weird woman. She recently listened to an episode about a serial killer from her home in Atlanta, Bee Killer, who terrorized the city.</text>
<correct_solution>{"afbc122a-0h5c-ka": {"full name": [],
"abbreviations": [],
"aliases": ["Jane"]},
"b4519c5f-a083-40", {"full name": [],
"abbreviations": [],
"aliases": ["Michael"]}
}</correct_solution>
<wrong_solution>
{"afbc122a-0h5c-ka": {"full name": ["Harold Shipman"],
"abbreviations": [],
"aliases": ["Atlanta Bee Killer"]},
"reasoning": "The entry is incorrect, as 'Atlanta' refers to Jane's hometown, while the serial killer's nickname is simply 'Bee Killer'.",
"bool": false
  }
</wrong_solution>

**Reponse of the LLM**:
```json
{"Persons": [{
"full name": ["Harold Shipman"],
"abbreviations": [],
"aliases": ["Bee Killer"]}
]}
```

## Example 2
<text>
Tom Hardy has been accused of stealing the royal crown. He was defended by the by the married lawer couple Martin and Nina Bauer. The judge was H, an experienced treasure robbery judge.
</text>
<correct_solution>{"3e7c6a9a-5fc5-43": {"full name": ["Tom Hardy"],
"abbreviations": [],
"aliases": []},
"bacf8ce2-7999-45", {"full name": ["Nina Bauer"],
"abbreviations": [],
"aliases": []}
}</correct_solution>
<wrong_solution>
{"838dd5fd-d955-43": {"full name": [],
"abbreviations": ["Martin"],
"aliases": []},
"reasoning": "The entry is incorrect, as Martin is married with Nina Bauer. Bauer clearly refers to both partners, not just Nina",
"bool": false
}
</wrong_solution>

**Reponse of the LLM**:
```json
{"Persons": [{
"full name": ["Martin Bauer"],
"abbreviations": [],
"aliases": []},
{
"full name": [],
"abbreviations": [],
"aliases": ["H"]}
]}
