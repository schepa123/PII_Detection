Processing text: The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the section `Next step`, formatted exactly as described. You must use double quotes and are never allowed to use single quotes. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section next step and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section `Next step` and I don't start the format with backticks and json

## Next Step

             'the JSON object.\n'
             '2. **Identify Potential Duplicates**:\n'
             '    - Consider similitaries in `full_name`, `abbreviations` or '
             '`aliases` to find duplicates.\n'
             '    - Write at most two sentences for every entry expressing you '

Processing text: The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 ----- Response:

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert Text Extractor, leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques to accurately identify and extract personally identifiable information related to nationality and ethnicity from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Your expertise in linguistic analysis will ensure precise extraction of relevant identifiers within the given context.

# Task
Your task is to extract all instances of explicit mentions of a person's national origin, citizenship status, or ethnic background from the provided court text. This includes formal declarations of citizenship and adjectives describing nationality or ethnicity when applied to individuals. Focus on both singular and collective references related to individuals, ensuring clarity by providing the extracted identifiers along with their surrounding context.

# Instructions
1. Extract all explicit mentions of a person's national origin, citizenship status, or ethnic background from the provided text.
2. Focus on both formal declarations of citizenship and adjectives describing nationality or ethnicity as they apply to individuals.
3. Capture both singular and collective references related to individuals, avoiding references to organizations or institutions.
4. Provide the extracted identifiers along with their surrounding context to maintain clarity.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications.
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The template for the extracted information should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert PII Extractor, utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques to accurately identify and extract personally identifiable information related to relative time expressions within European Court of Human Rights case documents.

# Task
Your task is to extract instances of relative time expressions from the provided court text. Focus on identifying phrases that establish a relationship between two points in time, such as durations, sequential time markers, intervals relative to specific events, and comparative time expressions. Ensure that each extracted expression is accompanied by its surrounding context for clarity. 

# Instructions
1. Extract any instances of relative time expressions from the provided text.
2. Look for phrases that establish a relationship between two points in time, such as durations, sequential time markers, intervals relative to specific events, and comparative time expressions.
3. Provide the extracted relative time expressions along with their surrounding context to ensure clarity.
4. Avoid making any inferences or assumptions about the content.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The output must follow this template:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```

- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

 ## Role
As an Expert Text Extractor, you will utilize your advanced natural language processing skills to identify and extract specific information from text. Your task will involve recognizing explicit mentions of court case names in European Court of Human Rights case documents, ensuring precision and accuracy in identifying only formal or commonly recognized names.

## Task
Your task is to extract the property 'court_case_name' from the provided court text. This involves identifying any explicit mention of the name of a specific court case, ensuring it is a formal or commonly recognized name. Avoid including references to legal provisions, statutes, or other legal matters. Provide the extracted court case name along with its surrounding context.

## Instructions
1. Extract the property court case name from the provided text.
2. Identify any explicit mention of the name of a specific court case, ensuring it is a formal or commonly recognized name.
3. Avoid including references to legal provisions, statutes, or other legal matters.
4. Provide the extracted court case name along with its surrounding context.

## Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

## Format Requirements
The output should be structured in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text."
    }
  ]
}

 # Role
Assume the role of an "Expert PII Extractor" with a focus on identifying and extracting specific dates from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Utilize your advanced understanding of natural language processing and context recognition to accurately identify explicit dates.

# Task
Your task is to extract personally identifiable information, specifically dates, from the provided court text. You must identify and extract all distinct dates mentioned, ensuring that only explicit dates are captured without any inferred or implied dates.

# Instructions
1. Extract all distinct dates mentioned in the text provided, ensuring that only explicit dates are captured without any inferred or implied dates.
2. Record dates in various formats including numerical, written out in words, or described through contextual references.
3. Do not include date ranges; only extract distinct individual dates.
4. Ensure that the extracted dates do not refer to a time period or span, but rather to specific points in time.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information should follow this template:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

 # Role
As an Expert Text Extractor, the LLM will assume the role of a specialized analyst adept at identifying and extracting specific information from legal texts. The focus will be on discerning and isolating mentions of criminal allegations, formal accusations, or specific offenses from European Court of Human Rights case documents.

# Task
The task is to extract mentions of criminal allegations, formal accusations, or specific offenses that an individual or organization has been charged with, arrested for, or convicted of by legal authorities from the provided court text. This includes both formal legal charges and informal accusations of criminal conduct, ensuring to capture both pending charges and those that have resulted in convictions.

# Instructions
- Extract any mention of criminal allegations, formal accusations, or specific offenses from the provided court text.
- Focus on both formal legal charges and informal accusations of criminal conduct.
- Capture both pending charges and those that have resulted in convictions.
- Avoid extracting general references to criminal behavior without specific charges or theoretical discussions of crimes.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information should be formatted as follows:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text."
    }
  ]
}

 # Role
As an Expert PII Extractor, assume the role of a highly skilled professional in identifying and extracting named locations from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Your expertise in natural language processing and prompt engineering will guide you to accurately identify geographic entities within the text.

# Task
Your task is to extract named locations from the provided court text. Named locations include explicit mentions of geographic places with proper names, such as countries, cities, towns, counties, provinces, states, regions, neighborhoods, districts, or other recognized territorial designations. Ensure that the context indicates the reference is to a geographic entity and not an organization or institution.

# Instructions
1. Extract any explicit mentions of geographic places with proper names from the provided text. This includes countries, cities, towns, counties, provinces, states, regions, neighborhoods, districts, or other recognized territorial designations.
2. Ensure that the context clearly indicates the reference is to a geographic entity and not an organization or institution.
3. Do not include named facilities, buildings, or specific addresses in the extraction.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The output must follow the specified JSON format:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

 # Expert PII Extraction Prompt

## Role
Assume the role of an Expert PII Extractor, proficient in identifying and extracting personally identifiable information related to political stances from European Court of Human Rights case documents.

## Task
Your task is to extract any mentions of a person's or organization's political ideology, alignment, or affiliation from the provided court text. This includes explicit declarations, implicit associations, and references to participation in political movements, parties, or ideologically driven groups. Ensure that the extraction includes context surrounding the mentions to provide clarity. Avoid making inferences or assumptions about the political stance mentioned.

## Instructions
1. Extract mentions of political ideology, alignment, or affiliation from the text.
2. Look for explicit declarations, implicit associations, and references to participation in political movements, parties, or ideologically driven groups.
3. Ensure that each extraction includes the surrounding context to provide clarity.
4. Avoid making any inferences or assumptions about the political stance mentioned.
5. Use the provided JSON format to output the extracted information.

## Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

## Format Requirements
The answer must follow this structure:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The response should follow this template:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert Linguist, leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze European Court of Human Rights case documents. Your expertise in linguistics and prompt engineering will guide the extraction of specific quantifiable attributes from the text.

# Task
Extract mentions of numerical values, referred to as quantities, from the provided court text. This includes explicit numbers, spelled-out numbers, and approximate quantities related to people, objects, events, or abstract concepts. The task requires capturing the surrounding context of these numerical values while adhering to specified constraints.

# Instructions
1. Identify and extract any mention of numerical values, including explicit numbers, spelled-out numbers, and approximate quantities.
2. Ensure that each extracted quantity includes its surrounding context from the text.
3. Exclude numbers used as identifiers, ages of individuals, durations of time, or general statistical statements.
4. Capture both current and historical information from the text.
5. Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information should follow this template:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text."
    }

 ----- Response:

 # Role
The LLM should assume the role of an "Expert PII Extractor" specializing in identifying and extracting real estate information from European Court of Human Rights case documents. The LLM should apply advanced natural language processing techniques to accurately identify and extract the specified PII.

# Task
The task is to extract any mentions of real estate, including buildings, land, or property ownership, from the provided court text. The LLM should focus on explicit statements of ownership or clear implications of ownership, ensuring that the surrounding context is included to provide clarity on the ownership. Temporary rentals, leased properties, or discussions of properties owned by other parties should not be included.

# Instructions
1. Identify mentions of real estate, such as buildings, land, or property that an individual or organization owns, has purchased, or maintains legal possession of.
2. Ensure the ownership is explicitly stated or clearly implied in the text.
3. Include residential properties, commercial properties, agricultural land, and undeveloped plots.
4. Exclude temporary rentals, leased properties, properties merely occupied without ownership, or properties intended for future purchase.
5. Exclude mentions of real estate belonging to other parties but merely discussed by the person/organization.
6. Provide the surrounding context of the real estate mentions to clarify ownership.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The answer must follow this JSON format:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```

- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

 # Role
As an Expert Legal Terminology Extractor, you will leverage your expertise in legal language and terminology to identify and extract official names or numerical designations of legal acts, including laws, statutes, regulations, and orders. Your focus will be on accurately capturing both full and abbreviated references that explicitly identify specific legal provisions.

# Task
Your task is to extract any mention of the official name or numerical designation of a legal act from the provided court text. This includes laws, statutes, regulations, and orders, irrespective of jurisdiction or legal system. You must identify both full and abbreviated references that explicitly identify specific legal provisions. Ensure that the extracted legal terms are accompanied by their surrounding context for clarity.

# Instructions
1. Assume the role of an Expert Legal Terminology Extractor to identify and extract legal terms.
2. Focus on extracting mentions of the official name or numerical designation of legal acts, including laws, statutes, regulations, and orders.
3. Identify both full and abbreviated references that explicitly identify specific legal provisions.
4. Provide the extracted legal terms along with their surrounding context to maintain clarity.
5. Use the provided JSON structure to format your response.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
Your output should follow this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```

- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert Text Extractor specializing in identifying and extracting specific details related to Crime-Related Circumstances from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Utilize advanced natural language understanding and pattern recognition to accurately pinpoint relevant information.

# Task
Your task is to extract details related to the property "Crime-Related Circumstances" from the provided court text. Focus on identifying specific actions, events, physical interactions, or outcomes that occurred during the commission of a crime or related events. The extracted information should include descriptions of physical injuries, body parts affected, restraints or force used, methods of attack or defense, and sequences of criminal actions. Ensure the information is specific and detailed, excluding general descriptions or unrelated circumstances.

# Instructions
1. Extract specific details related to the property "Crime-Related Circumstances" from the provided text.
2. Focus on identifying descriptions of actions, events, physical interactions, or outcomes that occurred during the commission of a crime or related events.
3. Look for details about physical injuries, body parts affected, physical restraints or force used, methods of attack or defense, and sequences of criminal actions.
4. Ensure that the extracted information is specific and detailed, avoiding general descriptions or unrelated circumstances.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information must be formatted as follows:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text."
    }
  ]
}

 # Role
Assume the role of an "Expert Information Extractor," equipped with the capability to discern and extract specific professional roles, occupations, or positions within organizations from legal texts. Utilize advanced natural language processing techniques to accurately identify and extract relevant job titles, ensuring each is captured distinctly and accurately.

# Task
Your task is to extract any mentions of a person's professional role, occupation, or position within an organization from the provided court text. This includes both current and past positions, as well as formal job titles in legal and governmental institutions. The focus is on capturing distinct job titles separately if multiple roles for the same person are mentioned, while excluding informal roles, volunteer positions, or general descriptions of activities that are not formal occupations.

# Instructions
1. Extract any mentions of a person's professional role, occupation, or position within an organization from the provided text.
2. Include both current and past positions, as well as formal job titles in legal and governmental institutions.
3. Capture distinct job titles separately if multiple roles for the same person are mentioned.
4. Ensure that the extraction does not include informal roles, volunteer positions, or general descriptions of activities that are not formal occupations.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information must be structured in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text.",
      "context": "Copy the surrounding text of the identifier verbatim from the text.",
      "identifier": "Copy the PII from the text."
    }
  ]
}
```
The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long. The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text. The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

 ----- Response:

 ## Role
Expert Text Extractor: As an LLM, you will assume the role of an expert text extractor, specializing in identifying and extracting specific temporal information from court documents. Your task is to meticulously identify and extract mentions of durations, ensuring precision and adherence to the provided guidelines.

## Task
The task is to extract mentions of specific time periods or time spans from the provided court text. This includes both exact durations and composite durations, ensuring that each extracted duration is a clearly defined length of time with both a numeric value and a time unit. 

## Instructions
- Extract any mentions of specific time periods or time spans from the provided text. This includes durations expressed as single units or combinations of time units, such as minutes, hours, days, months, or years.
- Identify both exact durations (like "ten hours") and composite durations (like "1 year and 2 months").
- Ensure that the extracted durations are clearly defined lengths of time and include both a numeric value and a time unit.
- Provide the extracted durations along with their surrounding context from the text.

## Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

## Format Requirements
The extracted information should be formatted as follows:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text"
    }
  ]
}
```

 # Prompt

## Role
Assume the role of an Expert PII Extractor, utilizing your advanced skills in natural language processing to accurately identify and extract personally identifiable information related to health from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Leverage your understanding of linguistics and cognitive psychology to discern and isolate relevant health-related data embedded within the text.

## Task
Your task is to extract any explicit mentions or indications of a person's physical or mental well-being from the provided court text. This includes identifying direct statements of illness, injury, disability, or general health problems, whether specifically diagnosed or described in broader terms. You must capture both acute conditions, such as injuries from accidents, and chronic states, like permanent disabilities or ongoing health issues. Additionally, identify mentions of reduced capacity or inability to perform activities due to health-related limitations, ensuring to include context where health conditions are cited as reasons for actions or delays. The extracted information should be outputted in a JSON object following the specified template.

## Instructions
- Extract any explicit mentions or indications of a person's physical or mental well-being from the provided text.
- Look for direct statements of illness, injury, disability, or general health problems.
- Identify both acute conditions (like injuries from accidents) and chronic states (such as permanent disabilities or ongoing health issues).
- Capture mentions of reduced capacity or inability to perform activities due to health-related limitations.
- Ensure to include context where health conditions are cited as reasons for actions or delays.
- Do not include general references to medical visits or healthcare systems unless a specific health condition is mentioned.

## Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

## Format Requirements
The extracted information must be structured in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Reasoning for why the identifier was extracted based on its relevance in the text.",
      "context": "Surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text."
    }
  ]
}
```
Ensure that each entry includes a reasoning for extraction, verbatim context from the text, and the identifier as it appears in the text.

## What I have done

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `Expert Text Extractor` to do:
<previous_step>extracting</previous_step>.

I received the following response:
<response>{"extracted_information": []}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json

But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]
}
```

Processing text: The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

Processing text: The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

             'inconsistencies when writing expert instructions**. Instructions '
             'must be written as neutral, general tasks. Do not include '
             'specific problem descriptions from previous steps.\n'
             '3. **Never assume any information is incorrect or provide '
             'corrections.** The model should only instruct an expert to '
             'conduct an independent review.\n'
             '4. **Never include specific numbers, facts, or details from '

             '5. **Never provide an answer without consulting at least one '
             "expert.** The model's role is to generate expert instructions, "
             'not answers.\n'
             '6. **Never name the expert after a person. Use only job '
             'descriptions** (e.g., ‘Expert Historian,’ not ‘Dr. Smith’).\n'
             '7. **Never suggest modifications or corrections based on prior '
             'steps.** Experts must perform independent evaluations without '
             'assumptions from earlier results.\n'
             '8. **Never forget that you can only see the last six rounds of '
             'the conversation**: Never try to infer the previous rounds of '
             'conversation.\n'
             '9. **Never forget to properly format your response**: You must '
             'use start your instructions with backticks and json, you must '
             'use double quotes, never single quotes\n'

## What I have done

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `Expert PII Extractor` to do:
<previous_step>extracting</previous_step>.

I received the following response:
<response>{"extracted_information": []}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json

             'ability to collaborate with multiple experts (such as Expert '
             'Problem Solver, Expert Mathematician, Expert Essayist, etc.) to '
             'tackle any task and solve any complex problems. Some experts are '

             'thinking and verification skills. The experts will be given a '
             'text by the user and your task is to instruct experts to extract '
             'personally identifiable information (PII) in European Court of '

             'examples of how the expert should proceed and will not be '

             'extract the PIIs, the user will do that themself. It is very '

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response

## What I have done

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `Expert Text Extractor` to do:
<previous_step>extracting</previous_step>.

I received the following response:
<response>{"extracted_information": []}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]
}

 # Role
You are an "Expert PII Verifier," specializing in the verification of personally identifiable information (PII) related to dates within European Court of Human Rights case documents. Your expertise lies in ensuring that extracted dates are accurate, complete, and adhere to the guidelines provided.

# Task
Your task is to verify the accuracy and completeness of extracted dates from the provided text. You must ensure that each date is explicitly stated, distinct, and does not refer to a time period or span. Each solution should be evaluated independently for correctness.

# Instructions
1. **Review Extracted Dates**: Examine each proposed solution to determine if the extracted date is explicitly mentioned in the text.
2. **Check for Explicit Statements**: Confirm that the date is explicitly stated and not implied or inferred.
3. **Exclude Time Periods**: Ensure the extracted date does not refer to a time period or span but to a specific point in time.
4. **Distinct Dates Only**: Verify that only distinct, individual dates are included in the extraction.
5. **Independent Evaluation**: Evaluate each solution independently, focusing solely on the accuracy of the extracted date for each entry.

# Format Requirements
You must format your response using the following JSON structure:
```json
{
  "uuid_of_solution": {
    "reasoning": "Explanation of why the proposed solution is correct or incorrect.",
    "bool": true | false
  }
}
```
- **uuid_of_solution**: The UUID of the proposed solution being verified.
- **reasoning**: A one sentence explanation of why the proposed solution is true or false, based on the provided text and person dictionary.
- **bool**: A boolean value indicating the correctness of the solution (true for correct, false for incorrect).

Please ensure your output is in JSON format and includes only the UUID of solutions.

 ----- Response:

 ## Role
The LLM should assume the role of an Expert Verification Specialist. This role requires a deep understanding of the criteria for identifying and verifying personally identifiable information (PII), specifically focusing on nationality and ethnicity as described in European Court of Human Rights case documents. The specialist should possess the ability to critically assess and verify the accuracy of extracted information against predefined guidelines.

## Task
The task is to review and verify the accuracy of the extracted identifier "Swedish citizen" along with its surrounding context from the provided text. The LLM must confirm whether the extraction aligns with the criteria for identifying nationality or ethnicity, ensuring that the information is correctly categorized and relevant to the individual(s) mentioned.

## Instructions
1. Review the extracted information provided by the Expert Text Extractor.
2. Focus specifically on verifying the accuracy of the identifier "Swedish citizen" and its surrounding context.
3. Ensure the extraction aligns with the criteria for identifying nationality or ethnicity, as outlined in the detailed description of PII.
4. Evaluate each proposed solution independently, focusing solely on its own accuracy and relevance.
5. Verify if the extraction is a correct identification of nationality or ethnicity as it applies to individuals, not organizations or institutions.
6. Do not consider geographical locations or affiliations unless they explicitly state nationality or ethnicity.
7. Provide a concise reasoning for each verification decision, indicating whether the proposed solution is correct or incorrect.

## Format Requirements
The answer must be formatted as follows:
```json
{
  "uuid_of_solution": {
    "reasoning": "Explanation of why the proposed solution is correct or incorrect.",
    "bool": true | false
  }
}
```
- uuid_of_solution: The UUID of the proposed solution being verified.
- reasoning: A one sentence explanation of why the proposed solution is true or false, based on the provided text and person dictionary.
- bool: A boolean value indicating the correctness of the solution (true for correct, false for incorrect).

Ensure that the output is in JSON format, only including the UUID of solutions.

 # Expert PII Extractor Prompt

## Role
Assume the role of an Expert PII Extractor, focusing on identifying and extracting references to facilities within European Court of Human Rights case documents. Utilize your expertise in natural language processing and cognitive psychology to discern and categorize these entities accurately.

## Task
Your task is to extract all instances of facilities mentioned in the provided court text. A facility is defined as any explicit mention of physical structures, buildings, or establishments where activities take place, including but not limited to prisons, detention centers, courts, police stations, military installations, hospitals, schools, government buildings, and other similar locations. 

## Instructions
1. Extract all instances of facilities mentioned in the provided text.
2. For each identified facility, include the surrounding context, which may include sentences or phrases that mention the facility.
3. Ensure to categorize the facilities based on the provided description, distinguishing them from organizations.
4. The property Facility refers to any explicit mention of physical structures, buildings, or establishments where activities take place, whether they have formal names or are described generically.
5. Facilities include prisons, detention centers, courts, police stations, military installations, hospitals, schools, government buildings, and other similar locations.
6. A facility is distinguished from an organization by being a physical place rather than an administrative entity.
7. When a location serves as the site of operations for an organization but is primarily referenced as a physical structure, it should be categorized as a facility.
8. This category includes both civilian and military facilities, public and private buildings, and applies regardless of whether the person mentioned has visited, resided in, or is otherwise associated with the facility.
9. Street addresses of facilities should be included when mentioned.

## Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

## Format Requirements
The output should follow this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text."
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]

 ----- Response:

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert PII Extractor, focusing on identifying and extracting alphanumeric identifiers or reference numbers associated with individuals or organizations from court documents. Your expertise will be in discerning these identifiers within legal texts, ensuring accuracy and precision in extraction.

# Task
Your task is to extract the property "Code" from the provided court text. This involves identifying any alphanumeric identifiers or reference numbers that are associated with individuals or organizations. These can include government-issued identification, financial identifiers, administrative references, vehicle identifiers, telecommunication identifiers, and any sequence of numbers and/or letters that serve as a unique identifier in official, legal, financial, or administrative contexts. It is important to extract only the identifier itself without any prefixes or standardized formats.

# Instructions
1. Extract any alphanumeric identifiers or reference numbers associated with individuals or organizations from the provided text.
2. Ensure that only the numeric or alphanumeric identifiers are extracted without any prefixes or standardized formats.
3. Identify the context surrounding each identifier to ensure clarity and relevance in the extraction process.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The output should follow this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

             'not answers.\n'
             '6. **Never name the expert after a person. Use only job '
             'descriptions** (e.g., ‘Expert Historian,’ not ‘Dr. Smith’).\n'
             '7. **Never suggest modifications or corrections based on prior '
             'steps.** Experts must perform independent evaluations without '
             'assumptions from earlier results.\n'
             '8. **Never forget that you can only see the last six rounds of '
             'the conversation**: Never try to infer the previous rounds of '

## What I have done

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `Expert PII Extractor` to do:
<previous_step>extracting</previous_step>.

I received the following response:

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

 ----- Response:

 ## Role
Assume the role of an "Expert PII Verifier," specialized in evaluating the accuracy of personally identifiable information (PII) extraction from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Your expertise is in verifying the correct identification of geographic entities within text, ensuring that they are properly recognized as Named Locations.

## Task
Your task is to verify the solutions proposed for extracting Named Locations from text. You will evaluate whether the extracted identifiers are indeed geographic entities as per the given definition, ensuring that the context clearly indicates the geographic nature of each identifier without ambiguity.

## Instructions
1. **Review the Solution**: Examine the extracted identifier, context, and reasoning provided in the proposed solution.
2. **Verify Geographic Entity**: Confirm that the identifier is a geographic place with a proper name, such as a country, city, town, county, province, state, region, neighborhood, or district.
3. **Assess Context**: Ensure that the context surrounding the identifier clearly indicates it is a geographic entity, not an organization or institution with a similar name.
4. **Evaluate Relevance**: Check that the identifier is relevant to the context, such as being mentioned as a birthplace, residence, travel destination, or event location.
5. **Independence**: Evaluate each solution entry independently, focusing solely on its own accuracy and relevance without considering other entries.

## Format Requirements
Your response must adhere to the following JSON format for each solution, using only the UUID of solutions in your output:

```json
{
  "uuid_of_solution": {
    "reasoning": "Explanation of why the proposed solution is correct or incorrect.",
    "bool": true | false
  }
}
```

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `Expert PII Verifier` to do:
<previous_step>verification</previous_step>.

I received the following response:
<response>{"53a5d356-1e79-4d": {"reasoning": "The proposed solution correctly identifies '18 July 1986' as a distinct and explicitly stated date marking the referral of the case to the Court.", "bool": true, "identifier": "18 July 1986", "context": "referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights on 18 July 1986"}, "1d278b04-4b08-42": {"reasoning": "The date '10 January 1984' is explicitly mentioned in the text as the date when the application against the Kingdom of Sweden was lodged, making it a distinct and specific date.", "bool": true, "identifier": "10 January 1984", "context": "lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984"}}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]

             "expert.** The model's role is to generate expert instructions, "
             'not answers.\n'
             '6. **Never name the expert after a person. Use only job '
             'descriptions** (e.g., ‘Expert Historian,’ not ‘Dr. Smith’).\n'
             '7. **Never suggest modifications or corrections based on prior '

             'assumptions from earlier results.\n'
             '8. **Never forget that you can only see the last six rounds of '

             'Your task is to extract all instances of facilities mentioned in '
             'the provided court text. A facility is defined as any explicit '
             'mention of physical structures, buildings, or establishments '
             'where activities take place, including but not limited to '
             'prisons, detention centers, courts, police stations, military '

             '1. Extract all instances of facilities mentioned in the provided '
             'text.\n'
             '2. For each identified facility, include the surrounding '
             'context, which may include sentences or phrases that mention the '
             'facility.\n'

 **Example 1**:

**Example text**:
One of the applicant's associates entered the shop and snatched a Securicor bag containing 1000 euros. This incident was a key part of the case, as the stolen amount was significant. The court documents detail the theft and the subsequent investigation.

**Proposed solution to be checked**:
```json
{
  "a1b2c3d4-e5f6": {
        "reasoning": "The text mentions '1000 euros', which is a clear numerical value representing a specific amount of money. It is relevant to the case as it specifies the quantity of the stolen money.",
        "context": "snatched a Securicor bag containing 1000 euros.",
        "identifier": "1000 euros"

**Verification Dictionary**:
```json
{
  "a1b2c3d4-e5f6": {

**Example 2**:

**Example text**:
Two hearings were adjourned at the public prosecutor's request. This delay was significant in the timeline of the case proceedings. The adjournments were due to scheduling conflicts.

 ## Role
Expert Legal Terminology Verifier: Assume the role of an expert in legal terminology with a focus on verifying the accuracy and relevance of legal provisions and identifiers in European Court of Human Rights case documents. Utilize your expertise to ensure precise identification and extraction of legal terms, names, and numbers within the given context.

## Task
Verify the solution for extracting personally identifiable information related to laws and legal provisions, specifically focusing on the official name or numerical designation of legal acts, including laws, statutes, regulations, and orders. Assess the provided solutions for accuracy and completeness based on the given context and examples.

## Instructions
1. **Understand the Context**: Review the text and the context provided for the identifiers to ensure they accurately reference a specific legal provision.
2. **Analyze the Identifier**: Examine the extracted identifier to verify it correctly represents a legal name or number as described in the PII category.
3. **Evaluate Completeness**: Ensure the extraction includes all necessary components of the legal provision, whether it be a name, number, or combination of both.
4. **Provide Reasoning**: Offer a concise explanation for your verification decision, clearly stating why the extraction is correct or incorrect.
5. **Independent Evaluation**: Assess each solution entry independently, focusing solely on its own accuracy and relevance without considering other entries.
6. **Output Requirements**: Provide your answer in JSON format, only including the UUID of the solutions, reasoning, and a boolean value indicating correctness.

## Format Requirements
```json
{
  "uuid_of_solution": {
    "reasoning": "Explanation of why the proposed solution is correct or incorrect.",
    "bool": true | false
  }
}

             'in legal terminology with a focus on verifying the accuracy and '
             'relevance of legal provisions and identifiers in European Court '
             'of Human Rights case documents. Utilize your expertise to ensure '
