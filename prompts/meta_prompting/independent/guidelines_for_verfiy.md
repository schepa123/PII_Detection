- **Single-entry scope**: Evaluate each UUID **independently** and judge only the correctness of **that entry** against the provided text and property rules. **Do not** penalize an entry because other valid PII items also appear in the text but are not present in the solution. Never write reasons like “omits other dates/PII.”
    - Example of correct application of this guideline:
        - Input: The applicants sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision. On 29 July 2001 the High Court refused leave on the papers. The applicants renewed their application and on 5 March 2001 leave was again refused after an oral hearing. On 13 January 2001 the applicants introduced an application to this Court and it was declared inadmissible in May 2001 on the basis that they had failed to exhaust domestic remedies (App. No. 34127/03). The applicants then applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal. On 30 March 2002 their application was unanimously rejected by the Court of Appeal.
        - Verification result: 
        ```json
        {{"753dbd21-3252-44": {{"reasoning": "The date '29 July 2001' is an exact calendar date explicitly stated in the text and represents a specific point in time, making it a valid temporal reference according to the definition.", "bool": true, "identifier": "29 July 2001", "context": "On 29 July 2001 the High Court refused leave on the papers."}}, "dad85cc2-8aac-4e": {{"reasoning": "The date '5 March 2001' is an exact calendar date explicitly stated in the text and represents a specific point in time.", "bool": true, "identifier": "5 March 2001", "context": "renewed their application and on 5 March 2001 leave was again refused"}}, "367e8560-d4b9-48": {{"reasoning": "The date '13 January 2001' is an exact calendar date explicitly stated in the text and represents a specific point in time.", "bool": true, "identifier": "13 January 2001", "context": "On 13 January 2001 the applicants introduced an application to this Court"}}, "e4f18f79-0536-43": {{"reasoning": "The date 'May 2001' is an exact calendar date explicitly stated in the text and represents a specific point in time", "bool": true, "identifier": "May 2001", "context": "it was declared inadmissible in May 2001 on the basis that they"}}, "96458673-9537-41": {{"reasoning": "The identifier '30 March 2002' is an explicit temporal reference representing a specific point in time that appears verbatim in the text and qualifies as a valid date extraction according to the definition.", "bool": true, "identifier": "30 March 2002", "context": "On 30 March 2002 their application was unanimously rejected by the Court"}}}}
        ```
        - This is correct, because every entry was extracted on it's own and you should correctness independent of others and not mark something as false because it failed to extracted other correct entries.
- **No omission-based failures**: Mark an entry **false** only if it fails on its own merits—e.g., the identifier is not a **non-empty, verbatim substring** of the provided text; the `identifier` does not meet the PII definition; the provided `context` does not contain the `identifier` verbatim or alters wording; or the entry fabricates/changes information. Do **not** list or suggest additional identifiers in the reasoning and do not reference completeness beyond the current UUID.
    - Reasoning like this is strictly false:
        -
        ```json
        {{"reasoning": "The solution correctly includes the quantity 'fifteen pre-trial hearings', while missing valid quantities like 'five ears' that should have been extracted.", "bool": false, "identifier": "fifteen pre-trial hearings", "context": "fifteen pre-trial hearings were held because of five ears"}}
        ```
        -
        ```json
         {{"72cd8144-9b87-40": {{"reasoning": "The extraction is incorrect because the proposed solution does not contain any date information to verify against the text, which contains multiple valid temporal references including '29 July 2003', '5 September 2003', '13 October 2003', 'December 2003', and '30 September 2004'.", "bool": false, "identifier": "December 2003", "context": "On 13 October 2003 the applicants introduced an application to this Court and it was declared inadmissible in December 2003 on the basis that they had failed to exhaust domestic remedies (App. No. 34127/03)."}}}}

- Allow grouped/compound spans when contiguous: If the text presents multiple instances of the same PII type within a single, contiguous, coordinated phrase (e.g., items joined by “and”, “or”, commas, slashes, en dashes, or parenthetical alternatives), an identifier that captures the entire coordinated span verbatim is valid. Do not mark it false for not splitting into separate entries
