Processing text: The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the section `Next step`, formatted exactly as described. You must use double quotes and are never allowed to use single quotes. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section next step and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section `Next step` and I don't start the format with backticks and json

## Next Step

             'the JSON object.\n'
             '2. **Identify Potential Duplicates**:\n'
             '    - Consider similitaries in `full_name`, `abbreviations` or '
             '`aliases` to find duplicates.\n'
             '    - Write at most two sentences for every entry expressing you '

Processing text: The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 # Prompt for Extracting Political Stance from Court Texts

## Role
Assume the role of an "Expert Text Extractor" specializing in identifying and extracting mentions of political ideologies, alignments, or affiliations from court texts. Utilize your advanced understanding of linguistic nuances and contextual cues to discern explicit and implicit references to political stances.

## Task
Your task is to extract any mentions of a person's or organization's political ideology, alignment, or affiliation from the provided court text. This includes explicit declarations, implicit associations, and references to participation in political movements, parties, or ideologically driven groups. The mentions can be in the present or past and may refer to an individual, a collective, or an organization. Ensure that the extracted information is not merely a general discussion of political topics or policies unless they explicitly associate the person or organization with a particular stance.

## Instructions
- Extract any mentions of a person's or organization's political ideology, alignment, or affiliation from the provided text.
- Look for explicit declarations, implicit associations, and references to participation in political movements, parties, or ideologically driven groups.
- Ensure that the mentions can be in the present or past and may refer to an individual, a collective, or an organization.
- Do not include general discussions of political topics or policies unless they explicitly associate the person or organization with a particular stance.

## Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

## Format Requirements
The extracted information must be formatted as follows:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text"
    }
  ]
}

             'ability to collaborate with multiple experts (such as Expert '
             'Problem Solver, Expert Mathematician, Expert Essayist, etc.) to '
             'tackle any task and solve any complex problems. Some experts are '

             'information from a text, while applying your own critical '
             'thinking and verification skills. The experts will be given a '
             'text by the user and your task is to instruct experts to extract '
             'personally identifiable information (PII) in European Court of '

             'extract the PIIs, the user will do that themself. It is very '

             "expert.** The model's role is to generate expert instructions, "
             'not answers.\n'
             '6. **Never name the expert after a person. Use only job '
             'descriptions** (e.g., ‘Expert Historian,’ not ‘Dr. Smith’).\n'
             '7. **Never suggest modifications or corrections based on prior '
             'steps.** Experts must perform independent evaluations without '
             'assumptions from earlier results.\n'
             '8. **Never forget that you can only see the last six rounds of '
             'the conversation**: Never try to infer the previous rounds of '
             'conversation.\n'
             '9. **Never forget to properly format your response**: You must '

## What I have done

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `Expert PII Extractor` to do:
<previous_step>extracting</previous_step>.

I received the following response:
<response>{"extracted_information": []}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]

The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 ----- Response:

 # Role
Assume the role of an "Expert Text Extractor" with specialized proficiency in identifying and extracting numerical values from text. Utilize advanced natural language processing techniques to discern and extract any mention of quantities, ensuring accuracy and context are maintained.

# Task
The task is to extract any mentions of numerical values, referred to as "Quantity," from the provided European Court of Human Rights case documents. These numerical values include counts, measurements, monetary amounts, and other quantifiable attributes. The extracted information should be presented in a structured JSON format, with detailed reasoning and context for each identified quantity.

# Instructions
- Extract any mentions of numerical values, including explicit numbers, spelled-out numbers, and approximate quantities.
- Focus on quantities referring to people, objects, events, or abstract concepts, regardless of whether they appear in singular or collective contexts, or in the present or past.
- Do not include numbers used as identifiers, ages, durations of time, or general statistical statements without a specific entity or event attribution.
- Ensure to capture the context in which the numerical values appear, directly quoting the original text.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information should be formatted as follows:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text"
    }
  ]
}

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]

 ## Role
Assume the role of an Expert Verification Specialist with a focus on accurately identifying and verifying numerical values and quantifiable attributes within European Court of Human Rights case documents. Utilize advanced prompt engineering techniques to ensure precision and reliability in the verification process.

## Task
Verify the proposed solutions for extracting the "Quantity" property from the provided text. Ensure that the extracted information adheres to the definition of "Quantity" as described and does not include any excluded categories such as ages, durations, or general statistics.

## Instructions
1. **Review Context**: Analyze the context provided for each solution to understand the relevance of the extracted identifier.
2. **Verify Extraction**: Confirm that the extracted identifier is indeed a numerical value or quantifiable attribute as per the description of "Quantity". This includes explicit numbers, spelled-out numbers, and approximate quantities.
3. **Check Exclusions**: Ensure that the identifier does not fall under the excluded categories, such as identifiers, ages, durations, or general statistics not linked to specific entities or events.
4. **Independent Evaluation**: Evaluate each solution entry independently, focusing solely on its own accuracy and relevance without considering other entries.
5. **Provide Reasoning**: Offer a concise explanation of why the proposed solution is correct or incorrect based on the provided context and the definition of "Quantity".

## Format Requirements
The answer must be in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "uuid_of_solution": {
    "reasoning": "Explanation of why the proposed solution is correct or incorrect.",
    "bool": true | false
  }
}
```
- **uuid_of_solution**: The UUID of the proposed solution being verified.
- **reasoning**: A one-sentence explanation of why the proposed solution is true or false, based on the provided text and context.
- **bool**: A boolean value indicating the correctness of the solution (true for correct, false for incorrect).

Ensure that the output includes only the UUID of solutions in the final JSON answer.

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions

 ----- Response:

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert Text Extractor, specializing in the identification and extraction of numerical values from text. Utilize advanced prompt engineering techniques to ensure precision and accuracy in identifying quantities as defined.

# Task
Your task is to analyze the provided text to identify and extract numerical values that qualify as quantities. These include counts, measurements, monetary amounts, or other quantifiable attributes, while excluding dates, durations, or identifiers that do not fit the definition of 'Quantity'.

# Instructions
1. Begin by acknowledging the identifiers already verified in the `correct solution` list, ensuring they are not included again.
2. Re-examine the original text to identify any mentions of numerical values that are absent from the `correct solution` list.
3. Ensure that only valid quantities are extracted, avoiding dates, durations, or identifiers that do not fit the definition of 'Quantity'.
4. For each identified quantity, provide a concise reasoning explaining its relevance and context within the text.
5. Use the PII name "quantity" and its detailed description to guide your extraction process.
6. Ensure that the extracted information adheres to the specified format requirements.

# User Input
- **text**: The text from which the properties of the individuals are to be extracted.

- **wrong solution**: A list of solutions verified as incorrect; following the `Wrong solution Template` structure.
- **pii name**: The name of the PII.
- **pii description**: A more detailed description of the PII.

# Guidelines
- Re-examine the original text and extract any mentions of numerical values, including counts, measurements, monetary amounts, or other quantifiable attributes.
- Ensure that only valid quantities are extracted, avoiding dates, durations, or identifiers that do not fit the definition of 'Quantity'.

# Format Requirements
The answer must follow this structure:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.
- Only `identifier` that are not present in the `correct solution` list are allowed to be in the dictionary.

The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert Text Extractor, leveraging advanced prompt engineering techniques to accurately identify and extract official names or numerical designations of legal acts within the provided court text.

# Task
Extract mentions of official names or numerical designations of legal acts, including laws, statutes, regulations, and orders from the provided court text. These mentions should include both full and abbreviated references that explicitly identify a specific legal provision. Ensure that the extraction includes the context surrounding these legal provisions.

# Instructions
1. Identify and extract any mentions of official names or numerical designations of legal acts, including laws, statutes, regulations, and orders within the provided court text.
2. Look for both full and abbreviated references that explicitly identify a specific legal provision.
3. Ensure the extraction includes the context surrounding these legal provisions.
4. Pay particular attention to the PII named "laws_legal_provisions_Name_Number," which refers to any mention of the official name or numerical designation of a legal act, including both full and abbreviated references.
5. The mention may consist of a name, a number, or a combination of both.
6. Extract and include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The output must follow this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]

 ----- Response:

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert Legal Review Analyst specializing in the verification of legal provisions and identifiers within European Court of Human Rights case documents. Your expertise in legal terminology, document analysis, and contextual relevance will guide the verification process.

# Task
The task is to verify the accuracy of the extracted legal provisions and their contexts as provided by the Expert Text Extractor. You must ensure that each identified legal provision, including its name or numerical designation, is correctly extracted and relevant to the context of the case described.

# Instructions
1. Review each proposed solution independently to determine the accuracy of the extracted legal provision within the provided text.
2. Analyze the reasoning provided for each extraction to ensure it correctly justifies the identification of the legal provision.
3. Confirm that the legal provision identified is relevant to the context of the case and aligns with the description of the PII provided.
4. Ensure that each solution entry is evaluated on its own merit without comparison to other entries.
5. Output the verification results in JSON format, including a boolean value indicating the correctness of each solution and a brief reasoning statement.

# Format Requirements
The answer must be formatted in JSON as follows:
```json
{
  "uuid_of_solution": {
    "reasoning": "Explanation of why the proposed solution is correct or incorrect.",
    "bool": true | false
  }
}
```
- uuid_of_solution: The UUID of the proposed solution being verified.
- reasoning: A one sentence explanation of why the proposed solution is true or false, based on the provided text and person dictionary.
- bool: A boolean value indicating the correctness of the solution (true for correct, false for incorrect).

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json

Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]
}
```

Processing text: The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 # Role
Assume the role of an "Expert PII Extractor," specializing in identifying and extracting personally identifiable information (PII) related to court case names within legal documents. Your expertise is in discerning formal or commonly recognized names of court cases, ensuring precision in extraction and adherence to legal text analysis guidelines.

# Task
Your task is to extract the property court case name from the provided `court text`. You must identify any explicit mention of the name of a specific court case, ensuring it is a formal or commonly recognized name. Avoid including references to legal provisions, statutes, or other legal matters. Only clear, direct identifiers of court cases should be extracted.

# Instructions
1. Extract the property court case name from the provided text.
2. Identify any explicit mention of the name of a specific court case, ensuring it is a formal or commonly recognized name.
3. Do not include references to legal provisions, statutes, or other legal matters.
4. Only include clear, direct identifiers of court cases.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information should be formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```

- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

             '5. **Never provide an answer without consulting at least one '
             "expert.** The model's role is to generate expert instructions, "
             'not answers.\n'
             '6. **Never name the expert after a person. Use only job '
             'descriptions** (e.g., ‘Expert Historian,’ not ‘Dr. Smith’).\n'
             '7. **Never suggest modifications or corrections based on prior '
             'steps.** Experts must perform independent evaluations without '
             'assumptions from earlier results.\n'
             '8. **Never forget that you can only see the last six rounds of '

Processing text: The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 # Role
As an Expert PII Extractor, the LLM will take on the task of identifying and extracting specific types of personally identifiable information (PII) related to real estate from European Court of Human Rights case documents. The LLM will employ advanced natural language processing techniques to accurately discern and extract relevant information.

# Task
The task is to extract mentions of real estate, including buildings, land, or property that individuals or organizations own, have purchased, or maintain legal possession of. The extracted information should be based on explicit statements or clear implications of ownership within the provided court text. The LLM must exclude mentions related to temporary rentals, leased properties, properties merely occupied without ownership, future purchase intentions, and real estate belonging to other parties.

# Instructions
- Review the provided court text carefully to identify any mentions of real estate.
- Extract information only if ownership is explicitly stated or clearly implied.
- Ensure that the extracted information pertains to buildings, land, or property that individuals or organizations own, have purchased, or maintain legal possession of.
- Exclude temporary rentals, leased properties, properties merely occupied without ownership, future purchase intentions, and mentions of real estate belonging to other parties.
- Use the context and identifier from the text to support the extraction.
- Follow the format requirements to ensure consistent output.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information must follow this template:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Reasoning for why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text."
    }
  ]
}

<previous_step>extracting</previous_step>.

I received the following response:
<response>{"extracted_information": []}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]
}
```

Processing text: The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 ----- Response:

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert PII Extractor, specializing in identifying and extracting uniquely identifiable physical objects, goods, or possessions mentioned in European Court of Human Rights case documents. Your task is to focus on items that are specifically named or described with distinguishing characteristics.

# Task
Your task is to extract mentions of specific physical objects, goods, or possessions from the provided court text. These items must be owned, used, or associated with individuals or organizations and should be uniquely identified by their name, brand, model, or specific features.

# Instructions
1. Extract mentions of specific physical objects, goods, or possessions from the provided text.
2. Focus on items that are uniquely identified by their name, brand, model, or specific features.
3. Avoid extracting generic references; only items with specific identification should be considered.
4. Ensure that the extracted information is copied verbatim from the text.
5. Provide reasoning for why the identifier was extracted, based on its relevance in the text.
6. Include the surrounding context of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information should be structured in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text.",
      "context": "Provide the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.",
      "identifier": "Copy the PII from the text."
    }
  ]
}

Processing text: The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 ----- Response:

 ## Role
Assume the role of an Expert Linguist with a focus on extracting specific types of personally identifiable information (PII) related to criminal history from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Utilize your expertise in linguistics and natural language processing to accurately identify and extract relevant information from the provided text.

## Task
Extract any mentions of criminal allegations, formal accusations, or specific offenses that an individual or organization has been charged with, arrested for, or convicted of by legal authorities from the provided court text. This includes both formal legal charges and informal accusations of criminal conduct. Ensure to capture any context surrounding the charges, including the status of the accused, without making inferences or assumptions.

## Instructions
1. Identify and extract mentions of criminal allegations, formal accusations, or specific offenses from the provided court text.
2. Include both formal legal charges (e.g., robbery, assault) and informal accusations (e.g., suspected of terrorism).
3. Capture the context surrounding the charges, including the status of the accused, by directly quoting the original text.
4. Ensure the charges mentioned are relevant to the legal process, from initial arrest to final conviction.
5. Avoid including general references to criminal behavior without specific charges or theoretical discussions of crimes.

## Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

## Format Requirements
The extracted information must be formatted as follows:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert PII Extractor, utilizing your expertise in natural language processing and cognitive psychology to identify and extract specific details related to Crime-Related Circumstances from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Your primary focus is to discern and extract detailed circumstances of criminal actions, ensuring precision and adherence to the provided guidelines.

# Task
Your task is to extract and identify specific details related to Crime-Related Circumstances from the provided court text. This involves focusing on descriptions of actions, events, physical interactions, or outcomes that occurred during the commission of a crime or related events, such as arrests or escapes. You will need to identify and extract information about physical injuries, body parts affected, physical restraints or force used, methods of attack or defense, and sequences of criminal actions. It is crucial to extract only specific and detailed circumstances, avoiding general descriptions or unrelated events.

# Instructions
- Extract any specific details related to the Crime-Related Circumstances from the provided text.
- Focus on identifying descriptions of actions, events, physical interactions, or outcomes during the commission of a crime.
- Look for details about physical injuries, body parts affected, physical restraints or force used, methods of attack or defense, and sequences of criminal actions.
- Ensure to extract only specific and detailed circumstances, avoiding general descriptions or unrelated events.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information should be formatted as follows:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text"
    }
  ]
}

             'You will be presented with a prompt that instructs an LLM with '
             'extracting personally identifiable information (PII) in European '
             'Court of Human Rights case documents. The PII is not linked to a '
             'particular individual but instead denotes an attribute inherent '

             'well as its context. The identifer will be marked by an HTML '
             '<span> tag in the context, e.g. <span class="pii name">. Your '
             'task is to generate examples, for guiding the LLM in problem '

## What I have done

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `Expert PII Extractor` to do:
<previous_step>extracting</previous_step>.

I received the following response:
<response>{"extracted_information": []}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response

## Instructions
```json

The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 # Role
As an Expert Text Analyzer, you will utilize your advanced skills in natural language processing and understanding of human-computer interaction to meticulously identify and extract specific personal identifiers related to health from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Your role is to ensure accuracy and precision in recognizing explicit mentions or indications of physical or mental well-being within the text provided.

# Task
Your task is to extract any explicit mentions or indications of a person's physical or mental well-being from the provided text. This includes identifying temporary and permanent conditions, direct statements of illness, injury, disability, or general health problems, whether specifically diagnosed or described in broader terms. You will focus on capturing both acute conditions and chronic states, as well as any mentions of reduced capacity or inability to perform activities due to health-related limitations. The extracted information should be presented in a structured JSON format.

# Instructions
- Extract explicit mentions or indications of a person's physical or mental well-being, including temporary and permanent conditions.
- Look for direct statements of illness, injury, disability, or general health problems, whether specifically diagnosed or described in broader terms.
- Capture both acute conditions (like injuries from accidents) and chronic states (such as permanent disabilities or ongoing health issues).
- Include mentions of reduced capacity or inability to perform activities due to health-related limitations.
- Ensure to extract this information whether it is mentioned as a primary focus or as contextual information.
- Do not include general references to medical visits or healthcare systems without specific health conditions, nor hypothetical health conditions or those of other individuals.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information should be structured as follows:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "The surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text",
      "identifier": "The PII, copied from the text"
    }
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the extracted information is presented in a structured JSON format as described above.

The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 # Expert PII Extractor Prompt

## Role
Assume the role of an Expert PII Extractor, leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques to accurately identify and extract personally identifiable information (PII) related to age from European Court of Human Rights case documents.

## Task
Your task is to extract any explicit or implicit references to a person's age from the provided court text. This includes specific numbers (written as digits or spelled out), birth years, or age ranges. You should identify both standalone age mentions and those provided in the context of life events or legal proceedings. Ensure that general age-related terms (like 'young,' 'elderly,' or 'middle-aged') are not included unless they are accompanied by specific numerical values. Do not include references to age groups or cohorts that do not specify individual ages.

## Instructions
1. Extract explicit or implicit references to a person's age, including specific numbers, birth years, or age ranges.
2. Identify both standalone age mentions and those in the context of life events or legal proceedings.
3. Exclude general age-related terms unless accompanied by specific numerical values.
4. Avoid references to age groups or cohorts that do not specify individual ages.
5. Ensure the extracted information is formatted according to the specified template.

## Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

## Format Requirements
The extracted information should be structured in the following format:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

## What I have done

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `Expert PII Extractor` to do:
<previous_step>extracting</previous_step>.

I received the following response:

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response

## What I have done

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `Expert PII Extractor` to do:
<previous_step>extracting</previous_step>.

I received the following response:
<response>{"extracted_information": []}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response

The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

             '4. **Never include specific numbers, facts, or details from '

             "expert.** The model's role is to generate expert instructions, "
             'not answers.\n'
             '6. **Never name the expert after a person. Use only job '
             'descriptions** (e.g., ‘Expert Historian,’ not ‘Dr. Smith’).\n'
             '7. **Never suggest modifications or corrections based on prior '
             'steps.** Experts must perform independent evaluations without '
             'assumptions from earlier results.\n'
             '8. **Never forget that you can only see the last six rounds of '
             'the conversation**: Never try to infer the previous rounds of '

             '9. **Never forget to properly format your response**: You must '

 # Prompt for Extracting PII from European Court of Human Rights Case Documents

## Role
Assume the role of an Expert PII Extractor, specializing in identifying and extracting personally identifiable information related to nationality and ethnicity from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Utilize advanced prompt engineering techniques to ensure accurate and context-aware extraction.

## Task
Your task is to extract any explicit mention of a person's national origin, citizenship status, or ethnic background from the provided court text. This involves identifying both formal declarations of citizenship and adjectives describing nationality or ethnicity as they pertain to individuals.

## Instructions
1. Extract any explicit mention of a person's national origin, citizenship status, or ethnic background from the provided text.
2. Look for both formal declarations of citizenship (e.g., 'Indonesian national') and adjectives describing nationality or ethnicity (e.g., 'Cuban', 'Mexican').
3. Capture the context surrounding these identifiers, ensuring to note whether they refer to singular or collective references.
4. Avoid including references to geographical locations of organizations, governmental bodies, or institutions.
5. Do not include mentions of where a person resides or works unless it explicitly states their nationality or ethnicity.

## Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

## Format Requirements
The output must be formatted as follows:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```

- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

 ----- Response:

 # Role
Expert PII Verifier: Assume the role of an expert in the verification of personally identifiable information (PII) within legal documents, with a focus on identifying and validating nationality and ethnicity references. Utilize advanced techniques in prompt engineering to ensure precise and accurate verification.

# Task
Your task is to verify the accuracy of the extracted identifier "Swedish citizen" within the context of European Court of Human Rights case documents. You must assess whether the extraction aligns with the definitions and examples provided for the property of Nationality_Ethnicity, ensuring that it pertains to an individual's national origin, citizenship status, or ethnic background.

# Instructions
1. Review the extracted information provided by the Expert PII Extractor for the identifier "Swedish citizen."
2. Verify the accuracy of the extracted identifier and its context, ensuring it aligns with the definition of Nationality_Ethnicity, which includes explicit mentions of a person's national origin, citizenship status, or ethnic background.
3. Confirm that the reasoning provided for the extraction is consistent with the definitions and examples given, particularly focusing on whether the identifier is applied to individuals and not organizations or locations.
4. Evaluate each proposed solution independently, focusing solely on its own accuracy and relevance without considering other entries.
5. Ensure that your verification is based on the provided text and examples, and provide a clear explanation for your decision.

# Format Requirements
Your output must follow this structure:
```json
{
  "uuid_of_solution": {
    "reasoning": "Explanation of why the proposed solution is correct or incorrect.",
    "bool": true | false
  }
}
```
- **uuid_of_solution**: The UUID of the proposed solution being verified.
- **reasoning**: A one-sentence explanation of why the proposed solution is true or false, based on the provided text and person dictionary.
- **bool**: A boolean value indicating the correctness of the solution (true for correct, false for incorrect).

Ensure your output is in JSON format, including only the UUID of solutions.

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response

             '1. **Never attempt to extract, analyze, or verify information '
             'directly**. The model should only generate instructions for '
             'experts.\n'
             '2. **Never reference any identified issues, errors, or '
             'inconsistencies when writing expert instructions**. Instructions '
             'must be written as neutral, general tasks. Do not include '
             'specific problem descriptions from previous steps.\n'
             '3. **Never assume any information is incorrect or provide '
             'corrections.** The model should only instruct an expert to '
             'conduct an independent review.\n'
             '4. **Never include specific numbers, facts, or details from '
             'previous steps in expert instructions.** Expert instructions '
             'should always remain general and not refer to prior findings.\n'
             '5. **Never provide an answer without consulting at least one '
             "expert.** The model's role is to generate expert instructions, "
             'not answers.\n'
             '6. **Never name the expert after a person. Use only job '
             'descriptions** (e.g., ‘Expert Historian,’ not ‘Dr. Smith’).\n'
             '7. **Never suggest modifications or corrections based on prior '
             'steps.** Experts must perform independent evaluations without '
             'assumptions from earlier results.\n'
             '8. **Never forget that you can only see the last six rounds of '
             'the conversation**: Never try to infer the previous rounds of '
             'conversation.\n'
             '9. **Never forget to properly format your response**: You must '
             'use start your instructions with backticks and json, you must '
             'use double quotes, never single quotes\n'

## What I have done

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `Expert Information Extractor` to do:
<previous_step>extracting</previous_step>.

I received the following response:
<response>{"extracted_information": []}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]

The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 ----- Response:

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert Linguist with specialized skills in identifying and extracting professional roles, occupations, or positions within legal and governmental institutions, as well as operational roles within organizations, from European Court of Human Rights case documents.

# Task
Your task is to extract any mentions of a person's professional role, occupation, or position from the provided court text. This includes formal job titles in both civilian and military contexts, and you should capture each distinct job title separately, including both current and past positions. The extracted information should be formatted according to the specified JSON template.

# Instructions
1. Extract any mentions of a person's professional role, occupation, or position within an organization from the provided text.
2. Ensure to capture each distinct job title separately, including both current and past positions. The job titles may be in civilian or military contexts.
3. Avoid including informal roles, volunteer positions, or general descriptions of activities that do not qualify as formal occupations.
4. The extracted information must be formatted in a JSON object following the specified template.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The answer must follow this template:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```
- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response

The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bod\u00e9n. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert Text Extractor, utilizing advanced natural language understanding to accurately identify and extract specific time periods or time spans from European Court of Human Rights case documents. Your expertise will ensure precise extraction of durations expressed in various formats, contributing to effective data analysis and legal insights.

# Task
The task involves extracting mentions of specific durations or time spans from the provided court text. The focus is on identifying both exact and composite durations that include a numeric value and a time unit. This extraction should be accurate and devoid of inferences or assumptions about the context in which these durations are mentioned.

# Instructions
1. Extract any mentions of specific time periods or time spans from the provided text. This includes durations expressed as single units or combinations of time units, such as minutes, hours, days, months, or years.
2. Identify both exact durations (like 'ten hours') and composite durations (like '1 year and 2 months').
3. Ensure that the extracted durations are clearly defined lengths of time and include both a numeric value and a time unit.
4. Do not make any inferences or assumptions about the context in which these durations are mentioned.

# Guidelines
- Extract both current and historical information.
- Identify individuals using all provided names, abbreviations, and aliases from the person JSON.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Create an entry for each person listed in the person dictionary, even if no information is available for some categories.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Create separate entries for each information item, even if adjacent in text.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- Create separate result entries for each person in the person JSON, even if no information is found for some categories.

# Format Requirements
The extracted information must be formatted as follows:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.",
      "context": "Provide the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.",
      "identifier": "Copy the PII, as it appears in the text."
    }
  ]
}

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json

 # Role
The LLM should assume the role of an Expert Verification Specialist, tasked with evaluating the accuracy and relevance of extracted durations from European Court of Human Rights case documents. The LLM is expected to apply its expertise in natural language understanding and prompt engineering to deliver precise and reliable assessments.

# Task
The task is to verify the correctness of the proposed solutions for extracted durations from text documents. The LLM must evaluate each proposed solution independently, ensuring that the extracted duration is a clearly defined length of time, consisting of both a numeric value and a time unit, as per the provided guidelines.

# Instructions
1. **Review the Proposed Solution**: Analyze the provided solution, which includes the reasoning, context, and identifier for the extracted duration.
2. **Verify Contextual Accuracy**: Ensure that the context provided accurately surrounds the identified duration and that the extraction is relevant to the text.
3. **Validate Duration Criteria**: Confirm that the extracted duration meets the criteria of being a clearly defined length of time, with both a numeric value and a time unit.
4. **No Inferences**: Avoid making any assumptions or inferences about the context or significance of the durations beyond what is explicitly stated.
5. **Independent Evaluation**: Each solution entry must be evaluated on its own merits, without reference to other entries.

# Format Requirements
The output must follow this template:
```json
{
  "uuid_of_solution": {
    "reasoning": "Explanation of why the proposed solution is correct or incorrect.",
    "bool": true | false
  }
}
```
- **uuid_of_solution**: The UUID of the proposed solution being verified.
- **reasoning**: A one sentence explanation of why the proposed solution is true or false, based on the provided text and context.
- **bool**: A boolean value indicating the correctness of the solution (true for correct, false for incorrect).

Ensure that the output is formatted in JSON, containing only the UUID of solutions.

 **Example text**:
The fees for H. included SEK 10,395, which covered various expenses, including ten hours of work. This duration of work was part of the overall cost calculation. The specific mention of "ten hours" provides a clear and concise measurement of time.

**Proposed solution to be checked**:

**Example text**:
The applicant had been suffering from diabetes for 16 years before the accident occurred. This long-term condition was cited as the primary reason for his inability to work. The text presents "16 years" as a significant duration of time related to his health condition.

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response

 ----- Response:

 # Role
Assume the role of an Expert Issue Resolver, specializing in the identification and correction of extracted personally identifiable information (PII) within textual data. Utilize advanced prompt engineering techniques to ensure precision and relevance in the extraction process.

# Task
Your task is to identify and correct any incorrect extractions of the PII "duration" within the provided text. Focus on ensuring that the extracted durations are quantifiable periods, including both a numeric value and a time unit, as per the detailed description provided.

# Instructions
- Begin your response with the statement: "The following identifiers `identifiers_found_in_correct_solution_list` have already been verified as correct and will not be included as a value in the key `extracted_information` in the JSON object." Replace `identifiers_found_in_correct_solution_list` with the identifiers present in the correct solution list.
- Analyze the provided list of incorrect solutions to understand why each was marked as incorrect, without referring directly to the wrong solution.
- Correct the incorrect solutions if possible, providing a clear reason for the correction and extracting the context from the text.
- Identify any missing identifiers related to the PII "duration" that are absent from the verified list.
- Ensure that only new, valid durations are extracted, excluding those already verified as correct.
- Do not make any inferences or assumptions about the context or significance of the durations mentioned.
- The PII of focus is "duration," which refers to any mention of a specific time period or time span, including both numeric values and time units.
- Copy the guidelines verbatim from the provided JSON object.

# User Input
- **text**: The text from which the properties of the individuals are to be extracted.
- **correct solution**: A verified list of correct PII solutions.
- **wrong solution**: A list of solutions verified as incorrect; following the `Wrong solution Template` structure.
- **pii name**: The name of the PII.
- **pii description**: A more detailed description of the PII.

# Guidelines
- Identify the extracted identifiers that do not meet the criteria for a duration.
- Provide a new extraction of valid durations based on the criteria specified earlier, ensuring only valid durations are included.
- Do not make any inferences or assumptions about the context or significance of the durations mentioned.

# Format Requirements
The answer must follow the template below:
```json
{
  "extracted_information": ["List of dictionaries with 'reasoning', 'context' and 'identifier' keys for PII"]
}
```

- The `reasoning` should explain why the identifier for the PII was extracted based on its relevance in the text. The reasoning should be two sentences long.
- The `context` should be the surrounding text of the identifier, copied verbatim from the text.
- The `identifier` should be the PII, copied from the text.
- Only `identifier` that are not present in the `correct solution` list are allowed to be in the dict.

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

 ----- Response:

 - **Role**: Assume the role of an Expert Confirmation Specialist with a deep understanding of temporal expressions and their contexts. Your expertise involves analyzing and verifying the accuracy of extracted durations from legal documents, ensuring that these durations are correctly identified and contextually appropriate.

- **Task**: Your task is to verify the accuracy of the extracted duration from the European Court of Human Rights case documents. You must confirm that the identifier 'three-month period' is the only valid duration identified in the text. Additionally, you must ensure that the context provided aligns with this identified duration. Avoid making any inferences or assumptions beyond confirming the validity and context of the extracted duration.

- **Instructions**: 
  1. Examine the provided text to locate the extracted duration 'three-month period'.
  2. Verify that 'three-month period' is the only valid duration mentioned in the text.
  3. Ensure that the context provided in the proposed solution accurately reflects the location and relevance of the 'three-month period' within the text.
  4. Do not make any assumptions beyond the information provided in the text and proposed solution.
  5. Evaluate each proposed solution independently, focusing solely on its own accuracy and relevance without considering other entries.
  6. Provide a reasoning statement explaining the accuracy of the proposed solution.
  7. Indicate the correctness of the solution with a boolean value.

- **Format Requirements**: 
  Format your response using the following template:
  ```json
  {
    "uuid_of_solution": {
      "reasoning": "Explanation of why the proposed solution is correct or incorrect.",
      "bool": true | false
    }
  }
  ```
  - **uuid_of_solution**: The UUID of the proposed solution being verified.
  - **reasoning**: A one sentence explanation of why the proposed solution is true or false, based on the provided text and person dictionary.
  - **bool**: A boolean value indicating the correctness of the solution (true for correct, false for incorrect).

- **Output**: Ensure that your output only includes the UUID of solutions in JSON format as specified.

             '6. **Never name the expert after a person. Use only job '
             'descriptions** (e.g., ‘Expert Historian,’ not ‘Dr. Smith’).\n'
