This includes both formal legal charges (such as robbery, assault, possession of weapons) and informal accusations of criminal conduct (such as being suspected of terrorism). The charges may be explicitly stated in legal terms or described in more general terms that clearly indicate criminal conduct. This feature encompasses both pending charges and those that have resulted in convictions, as well as the status of the accused. It does not include general references to criminal behavior without specific charges, or theoretical discussions of crimes. The charges can be mentioned in any stage of the legal process, from initial arrest through final conviction.

    description: The property Crime-Related Circumstances of the category Criminal History refers to any mention of any specific details about the actions, events, physical interactions, or outcomes that occurred during the commission of a crime or during related events (such as arrests or escapes). This includes descriptions of physical injuries sustained by any party, specific body parts affected, details of physical restraints or force used, methods of attack or defense, and sequences of criminal actions.

health:
    description: The property Health of the of the category Demographics refers to any explicit mentions or indications of a person's physical or mental well-being, including temporary and permanent conditions. This encompasses direct statements of illness, injury, disability, or general health problems, whether specifically diagnosed or described in broader terms. The property covers both acute conditions (like injuries from accidents) and chronic states (such as permanent disabilities or ongoing health issues). It includes mentions of reduced capacity or inability to perform activities due to health-related limitations, such as loss of working capacity or partial disability. The property should be captured whether the health status is mentioned as a primary focus or as contextual information, such as when health conditions are cited as reasons for actions or delays. This property does not include general references to medical visits or healthcare systems when no specific health condition is mentioned, nor does it include hypothetical health conditions or health conditions of other individuals mentioned in relation to the person.
    example:
        - He claimed that the defendant companies should be held liable to pay, jointly and severally, a specified amount in compensation for <span class="Health">permanent disablement and loss of working capacity</span>.

age_number:
    description:  The property Age (number) of the subcategory Age of the category Demographics refers to any explicit or implicit reference to a person's age, including specific numbers (whether written as digits or spelled out), birth years, or age ranges. This includes both current and historical age references, as well as relative age indicators when paired with specific temporal markers. The property captures both standalone age mentions and those provided in context of life events or legal proceedings. It does not include general age-related terms (like "young," "elderly," or "middle-aged") unless accompanied by specific numerical values, nor does it include references to age groups or cohorts (such as "millennials" or "baby boomers") that don't specify individual ages.
    example:
        - At the time Ms A and the applicant had been <span class="Age (Number)">seventeen</span> and <span class="Age (Number)">twenty-three years</span> old, respectively. Together they had left a party at Mr C’s home in order to buy mineral water at the petrol station.

Nationality_Ethnicity: 
    description: The property Nationality_Ethnicity of the subcategory Heritage of the category Demographics refers to any explicit mention of a person's national origin, citizenship status, or ethnic background. This includes both formal declarations of citizenship (e.g., "Indonesian national," "Chinese citizen") and adjectives describing nationality or ethnicity when applied to individuals (e.g., "Cuban," "Mexican"). This property should be captured whether the nationality or ethnicity is mentioned as a primary identifier or as supplementary information about the person. The property applies to both singular references (referring to one person) and collective references (referring to multiple people who share the same nationality or ethnicity), as long as it refers to individuals rather than organizations or institutions. This feature does not include references to the geographical location of organizations, governmental bodies, or institutions (e.g., "Cuban court," "Mexican ministry," "Haitian Human Rights group"), nor does it include mentions of where a person resides or works unless it explicitly states their nationality or ethnicity.
    example:
        - The applicant, Mr. Gunnar Bodén, was born in 1939. He is a <span class="Nationality_Ethnicity">Swedish citizen</span> resident in Falun and a car driver by profession.

job_title:
    description: The property Job Title of the subcategory Professional Life of the category Demographics refers to any mention of a person's professional role, occupation, or position within an organization, whether it is a current or past position. This includes formal job titles in legal and governmental institutions and designations and operational roles within organizations. The job title can be either a permanent position or a temporary role, and it may be mentioned in both civilian and military contexts. This property should capture professional roles regardless of their seniority level, from entry-level positions to high-ranking official titles. However, it should not include informal roles, volunteer positions, or general descriptions of activities that are not formal occupations. When the text mentions multiple roles for the same person, each distinct job title should be captured separately.
    example:
        - The applicant, Mr. Gunnar Bodén, was born in 1939. He is a Swedish citizen resident in Falun and a <span class="Job Title">car driver</span> by profession.
        - The applicant’s release from prison would therefore be at the Home Secretary’s discretion, following a favourable recommendation from the Parole Board and after consultation with the <span class="Job Title">Lord Chief Justice</span>, if available.

duration:
    description: The property Duration of the category Datetime refers to any mention of a specific time period or time span, whether expressed as a single unit or a combination of time units (such as minutes, hours, days, months, or years). This includes durations related to sentences, work periods, illness progression, or any other temporal measurements explicitly stated in the text. The duration must be a clearly defined length of time, not just a date or point in time. The property captures both exact durations (like "ten hours") and composite durations (like "1 year and 2 months"). It encompasses durations that describe lengths of imprisonment, periods of illness, work hours, or any other measurable time spans associated with events, conditions, or activities. The duration should be a quantifiable period, meaning it must include both a numeric value (whether written as numbers or spelled out in words) and a time unit.
    example:
        - These included H.’s fees which amounted to SEK 10,395 for, inter alia, <span class="Duration">ten hours</span> of work.
        - The main reason for the applicant’s inability to work was diabetes, from which he had suffered for <span class="Duration">16 years</span> at the time of the accident.

date:
    description: The property Date of the category Datetime refers to any temporal reference that indicates a specific point or period in time, regardless of its format or level of precision. This includes exact calendar dates, seasons with years or years alone. The date can be expressed either in a numerical format, written out in words, or described through contextual references (such as references to historical events with clear temporal associations). Both singular dates and date ranges should be captured, and each distinct date within a range should be recorded separately. But you should only extract the distinct date not the range. The reference can be either a standalone temporal marker or embedded within a broader historical or personal context, such as birth dates, event dates, or administrative dates, but can't refer to a time period or time span, only to a specific point in time. The date must be explicitly stated in the text; implied dates or dates that require calculation or inference should not be included.
    example:
        - The applicant settled in Sweden in the <span class="Date">second half of the 1980s</span>.
        - A daughter was born out of the relationship on <span class="Date">16 October 1996</span>.
        - In <span class="Date">1986</span> the applicant commenced his military training in Iran.

realtive_time:
    description: The property Relative Time of the category Datetime refers to any temporal expression that establishes a relationship between two points in time, rather than specifying an absolute date or time. This includes references to durations (e.g., "two weeks later," "after three months"), sequential time markers (e.g., "subsequently," "following that"), intervals relative to specific events (e.g., "within 72 hours of admission," "5 days before the incident"), and comparative time expressions (e.g., "earlier than," "prior to"). However, this property does not include absolute dates (e.g., "January 4, 2000"), fixed calendar references (e.g., "every Monday"), or general time-of-day expressions (e.g., "at noon") unless they are explicitly used to establish a relative relationship with another point in time.
    example:
        - The applicant suffered a heart attack which caused him to fall. About <span class="Relative Time">two weeks later</span>, he also suffered a cerebral stroke.
        - A Special Report form dated 4 January 2000 (relating to detention beyond the <span class="Relative Time">seventy-second day</span> which would fall on 13 January 2000) also recorded that the applicant was likely to suborn witnesses.

named_location:
    description: The property Named Location of the category Location refers to any explicit mention of a geographic place with a proper name, including countries, cities, towns, counties, provinces, states, regions, neighborhoods, districts, or other recognized territorial designations. This category encompasses political, administrative, or naturally defined areas with officially recognized names. Named Locations may be mentioned as someone's birthplace, residence, travel destination, or location of events. This property excludes named facilities (like hospitals, schools, prisons), buildings, or specific addresses. Both current and historical place names are included, as well as references to locations regardless of their size or significance. The context should clearly indicate that the reference is to a geographic entity rather than an organization or institution that happens to share a name with a place.
    example:
        - The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in <span class="Named Location">London</span>.
        - In 1999 he was serving as a gunner with the 12th Regiment of the Royal Artillery and was stationed in <span class="Named Location">Germany</span>.

facility:
    description: The property Facility of the category Location refers to any explicit mention of a physical structures, buildings, or establishments where activities take place, whether they have formal names or are described generically. This includes prisons, detention centers, courts, police stations, military installations, hospitals, schools, government buildings, and other similar locations. A facility is distinguished from an organization by being a physical place rather than an administrative entity. When a location serves as the site of operations for an organization but is primarily referenced as a physical structure (like "Human Rights Building" vs "Human Rights Commission"), it should be categorized as a facility. This category includes both civilian and military facilities, public and private buildings, and applies regardless of whether the person mentioned has visited, resided in, or is otherwise associated with the facility. Street addresses of facilities should be included when mentioned.
    example:
        - The applicant was born in 1964 and is currently detained in <span class="Facility">HM Prison Brixton</span>.
        - The hearing was held in public at the <span class="Facility">Human Rights Building</span>, Strasbourg.

This includes codes that appear with prefixes or in standardized formats (such as no., ref., file nos.), as well as those presented in sequences or lists, but you must extract only the number not the prefixes or standardized formats The identifier must be specific enough to potentially enable identification of a particular individual or organization when combined with other information."
    example:
        - The applicants further initiated execution proceedings before the İslahiye Execution Office to obtain those amounts ordered by the İslahiye Civil Court of First Instance (file nos. <span class="Code">2004/351</span< and <span class="Code">2004/352</span>).
