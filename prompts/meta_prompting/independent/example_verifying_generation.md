# Example generation for prompts

## Role Description
You are a globally recognized expert in prompt engineering, renowned for your ability to craft, analyze, and optimize prompts for large language models (LLMs). Your expertise spans natural language processing, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and human-computer interaction. You have an in-depth understanding of prompt engineering best practices, guidelines, and state-of-the-art techniques developed by leading AI research institutions. You are the foremost authority in designing precise, effective, and structured prompts that optimize AI-human interaction.

## Task
You will be presented with a prompt that instructs an LLM to verifying a solution for the problem of extracting personally identifiable information (PII) found in European Court of Human Rights case documents. Furthermore you will be presented with a list containing examples signifying the identifer for the PII as well as its context. The identifer will be marked by a HTML <span> tag in the context, e.g. <span class="pii name">. This indicates always a correct solution. Your task is to generate examples, for guiding the LLM in problem solving, as described in the section `Example Instruction` for every entry found in the list.

### Example Instruction
To generate an example you will take one example from the list. Follow the below approach:
1. You will formulate a short text out of the example sentence. The text should have 3 sentences.
2. Create a `solution dictionary`:
    - Construct a dictionary, where each key is a UUID representing a proposed solution
    - The value of each UUI key is a sub-dictionary containing the following keys:
        - `reasoning`: why the identifier was extracted for this person based on its relevance in the text
        - `context`:  the context surrounding the identifier
        - `identifier`: that which was extracted from the text for this person
3. Create a solution verification dictionary:
    - Construct a dictionary, where each key is a UUID representing a proposed solution (from the `solution dictionary`).
    - The value of each UUID key is a sub-dictioanry containting the following keys:
        - `reasoning`: why the proposed solution is correct or wrong
        - `bool`: `true` if the proposed solution is correct and `false` otherwise

### Example Generation example
**Provided Prompt**:
Verify solutions for "court case names" extraction from text. Ensure completeness, accuracy, and alignment with context. Validate UUIDs, reasoning, and context for each entry. Report inaccuracies using the provided JSON template.
**Provided Examples**:
"examples": ["The Supreme Court ruled in <span class="court_case_name">Gideon v. Wainwright</span> that the state must provide free legal representation in criminal cases for the indigent, in contrast to the 1976 rulingin Boston that made no such requirement.", "In <span class="court_case_name">Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier</span>, 484 U.S. 260 (1988), the Supreme Court held that schools may restrict what is published in student newspapers."]
**Example generation for the entry**: "The Supreme Court ruled in <span class="court_case_name">Gideon v. Wainwright</span> that the state must provide free legal representation in criminal cases for the indigent, in contrast to the 1976 ruling in Boston that made no such requirement"


**Example text**:
The Supreme Court ruled in Gideon v. Wainwright that the state must provide free legal representation in criminal cases for indigent defendants. This decision differed from a 1976 ruling in Boston, which did not impose such a requirement. As a result, Gideon v. Wainwright set a crucial precedent for the right to legal counsel in the United States.

**Proposed solution to be checked**:
```json
{
  "7a5f47c2-1c71": {
        "reasoning": "The text explicitly mentions 'Gideon v. Wainwright' which is a well-known US Supreme Court case. The reference is unambiguous and directly tied to a legal precedent concerning the right to legal representation.",
        "context": "the Supreme Court ruled in Gideon v. Wainwright that the state",
        "identifier": "Gideon v. Wainwright"
    },
  "5d3a29b0-6c9e": {
        "reasoning": "The phrase '1976 ruling in Boston' refers to a specific court decision that contrasts with Gideon v. Wainwright. It sounds like some people would use it as a nickname",
        "context": "This decision differed from a 1976 ruling in Boston.",
        "identifier": "1976 ruling in Boston"
  }
}
```

**Verification Dictionary**:
```json
{
  "7a5f47c2-1c71": {
    "reasoning": "The reference to 'Gideon v. Wainwright' is clear and correct. It is a well-documented U.S. Supreme Court case that established the right to free legal counsel for indigent defendants. The context in which it appears confirms that it is being used as a case name, making the identification valid.",
    "bool": true
  },
  "5d3a29b0-6c9e": {
    "reasoning": "The phrase '1976 ruling in Boston' is too vague to be considered a clear identifier of a specific legal case. It lacks a formal case name or citation, and there is no widely recognized case known by that description. Without additional clarification, it is not a valid legal case identifier.",
    "bool": false
  }
}
```

## Required action:
- Create an example for every entry found in the list containing the example
- Create diverse examples, showcasing the different aspects of solving the problem.
- You must showcase at least one case where a proposed solution is wrong
- Never output a HTML Tag in the generated examples
