Nationality_Ethnicity: 
    description: The property Nationality_Ethnicity refers to any explicit mention of a person's national origin, citizenship status, or ethnic background. This includes both formal declarations of citizenship (e.g., “Indonesian national,” “Chinese citizen”) and adjectives describing nationality or ethnicity when applied to individuals (e.g., “Cuban,” “Mexican”). This property should be captured whether the nationality or ethnicity is mentioned as a primary identifier or as supplementary information about the person. The property applies to both singular references (referring to one person) and collective references (referring to multiple people who share the same nationality or ethnicity), as long as it refers to individuals rather than organizations or institutions. However, this property also extends to the nationality or geographic affiliation of organizations, companies, or collective entities when such adjectives explicitly denote their national identity or origin (e.g., “German manufacturer,” “Swedish company,” “French bank”). It thus covers references that ascribe national identity or affiliation to both persons and institutional actors when nationality functions as an identifying attribute rather than merely a geographical locator. This feature does not include references to the geographical location of organizations, governmental bodies, or institutions (e.g., “Cuban court,” “Mexican ministry,” “Haitian Human Rights group”), nor does it include mentions of where a person resides or works unless it explicitly states their nationality or ethnicity.

date:
    description: The property Date refers to any temporal reference that indicates a specific point or period in time, regardless of its format or level of precision. This includes exact calendar dates, seasons with years or years alone (which are considered a valid specific point in time for this property). It also includes calendar-day expressions without a year (e.g., “6 February”), which should be extracted as written without inferring the missing component, provided they function as dates in the narrative.The date can be expressed either in a numerical format, written out in words, or described through contextual references (such as references to historical events with clear temporal associations). Both singular dates, multi-date expressions, year numbers and date ranges should be captured, and each distinct date within a range should be recorded separately. But you should only extract the distinct date not the range, however, when the text lists multiple specific dates together, whether separated by “and”, commas, slashes, or an en dash, you should extracte the dates as one entry. The reference can be either a standalone temporal marker or embedded within a broader historical or personal context, such as birth dates, event dates, or administrative dates, but can't refer to a time period or time span, only to a specific point in time. The date must be explicitly stated in the text; implied dates or dates that require calculation or inference should not be included. Exclude years or numeric strings that form part of the official title of an instrument, organization, publication, case, model, or similar nominal identifier (e.g., “Prison Rules 1964”, “Expropriation Act 1972”), when they function as names rather than temporal references; do not extract the year from such titles even if it looks like a calendar year. Also exclude numeric identifiers embedded in legal or administrative document names (e.g., “Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen 1991:1469”, “Regulation (EU) 2016/679”, “Act No. 2005:123”), where the year forms part of a structured code or citation rather than denoting a date.
