- Always take into account both current and historical information.
- Output results in a JSON object following the specified template.
- Include contextual information by directly quoting the original text.
- Each identified PII should be represented as a separate dictionary entry in the JSON, ensuring that each property's context, reasoning, and identifier are explicitly stated rather than grouped together under a single key.
- Copy identifiers verbatim from the text without modifications (e.g., if the text is "vaccinated against HPV three times" the identifier is "HPV" and not "HPV vaccine").
- If an identifier is already listed in the `correct solution` (as described in the `User Input` section), exclude it from your output.
- Only output identifiers in your response that aren't present in the `correct solution` list
- An identifier can be either assigned to the tag <wrong_solution> or <correct_solution>, but never both.
- Verbatim principle: All textual elements you output (identifiers, context, and any quoted fragments in reasoning) must be exact substrings of the provided textâ€”no paraphrasing, normalization, reformatting, or invented wording.
- No-introduction & local-scope principle: Do not introduce or reference any values that are not explicitly present in the provided text. Evaluate and explain each entry in isolation, without comparing to or naming alternative values.
