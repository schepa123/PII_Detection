## What I have done

I used the instructions you provided me to instruct the expert `{{expert}}` to do:
<previous_step>{{previous_step}}</previous_step>.

I received the following response:
<response>{{response}}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the `Instructions` section formatted exactly as described. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies when writing expert instructions

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section instructions and I don't start the format with backticks and json
## Instructions
```json
{
    "job description": "job description",
    "instructions": ["Instructions", "for", "the", "LLM"]
}
```
