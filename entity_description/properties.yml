political_stance:
    description: The property Political Stance of the category Worldview is any mention of a person's or organization's political ideology, alignment, or affiliation. This includes explicit declarations (e.g., "John is a socialist"), implicit associations (e.g., "John supports left-wing policies"), and references to participation in political movements, parties, or ideologically driven groups (e.g., "The organization was founded on Marxist-Leninist principles"). Mentions can be in the present or past and may refer to an individual, a collective, or an organization. This property does not include general discussions of political topics or policies unless they explicitly associate the person or organization with a particular stance.

laws_legal_provisions_Name_Number:
    description: The property laws & legal provisions/name_number is any mention of the official name or numerical designation of a legal act, including laws, statutes, regulations, and orders. This applies regardless of the jurisdiction or legal system and includes both full and abbreviated references, as long as they explicitly identify a specific legal provision. The mention may consist of a name, a number, or a combination of both. Include provision-level labels (e.g., “Article/Art.”, “Rule”, “Section/S.”, “Paragraph/§”, “Schedule”) only when the span also contains the official instrument name (e.g., “Article 146 § 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code”, “Order 19, rule 7 of the County Court Rules”). Exclude bare or anaphoric references lacking the instrument name (e.g., “Article 27 § 1”, “Rule 59 § 3 in fine”, “paragraph 6 of Schedule 2”, “the Order”, “the Convention”, “the Rules”). References to internal court/tribunal procedural rules or practice directions (e.g., “Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court”) are excluded, even when formally numbered, as they do not constitute external legal instruments but internal procedural norms. Mentions composed only of a generic numerical label (e.g., “Law no. 5190”) should be excluded, unless the span also includes the law’s official name. Exclude references to any article, protocol, or rule connected to the “Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms” (e.g., “Protocol No. 11 to the Convention”, “Article 27 § 2 of the Convention”), as these are treaty provisions, not domestic laws or statutory instruments. Never include any reference to any article, etc. from the "Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms" or "Human Rights Act".
    example:
        - The case was referred for hearing by way of arbitration under <span class="laws_legal_provisions_Name_Number">Order 19, rule 7</span>, of the County Court Rules.
        - It sentenced the applicant to 15 years’ imprisonment under <span class="laws_legal_provisions_Name_Number">Article 146 § 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code</span>.
        - In the 1990s a number of books published by the applicant's company were found to contain propaganda in breach of various provisions of the <span class="laws_legal_provisions_Name_Number">Prevention of Terrorism Act</span>.
        - However, the Government, taking the view that the Municipal Council had shown the need to include the applicant’s properties, concluded that the conditions laid down in the <span class="laws_legal_provisions_Name_Number">Expropriation Act 1972</span> were satisfied.

court_case_name:
    description: The property court case/name of the category Legal Matters refers to any explicit mention of the name of a specific court case. This property is limited to the formal or commonly recognized names of court cases, and does not include references to legal provisions, statutes, or other legal matters. Only clear, direct identifiers of court cases are included in this property.
    example:
        - In this case the “fear” of lack of impartiality by the applicant had been “objectively justified” (see <span class=court_case_name>Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy</span>, 7 August 1996, § 58).

real_estate:
    description: The property Real Estate of the category Property & Item is any mention of buildings, land, or property that an individual or organization owns, has purchased, or maintains legal possession of. This includes residential properties (houses, apartments, vacation homes), commercial properties (office buildings, retail spaces, warehouses), agricultural land, and undeveloped plots. The ownership must be explicitly stated or clearly implied in the text. This feature does not include temporary rentals, leased properties, properties that the person/organization merely occupies without ownership, or properties they intend to purchase in the future. It also excludes mentions of real estate that belong to other parties but are merely being discussed by the person/organization.
    example:
        - He owned, together with his brother Mr. B. Bodén, the properties <span class="real_estate">Källviken 1:18, 1:25 and 1:26</span>.
        - The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Glasgow. He is an advocate by profession. He <span class="real_estate">owned a flat in a tenement building</span> in Edinburgh.

quantity:
    description: The property Quantity is any mention of a numerical value, regardless of type, including but not limited to counts, measurements, monetary amounts, or other quantifiable attributes. This includes explicit numbers, spelled-out numbers, and approximate quantities (e.g., "several witnesses"). Mentions can refer to people, objects, events, or abstract concepts and can appear in singular or collective contexts, in the present or past. This property does not include references to numbers used as identifiers (e.g., case numbers, postal codes), references to the age of individuals, references to the duration of time (e.g., "10 hours" or "20 days"), references to any amount of time (e.g. "seven and a half years"), references to any point in time (e.g. "10.06.1996", “2 February 1996) or general statistical statements that do not attribute the quantity to a specific entity or event. Furthermore time referernces like "28 days' imprisonment" are strictily excluded. References to any amount of time are not part of this property. Do not extract vague degree quantifiers that lack numeric boundedness—e.g., “many”, “numerous”, “a number of”, “a lot of”, “several witnesses“. Exclude boilerplate or container phrases (e.g., “a number of matters”) when they do not specify a concrete count of a well-defined entity. **Never** include date references and case numbers. As a general rule, you are not allowed to include any item with the words `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `months`, `years`. Exclude relational or comparative quantifiers that imply proportion but not measurable count (e.g., “one of whom”, “one of which”, “each of them”), as these do not quantify an external referent but rather indicate membership or reference within a set
    example:
        - One of the applicant's associates entered the shop, snatched a Securicor bag containing <span class="quantity">1000 euros</span>.
        - <span class="quantity">Two hearings</span> were adjourned at the public prosecutor's request.
        - In 1995 the trial heard <span class="quantity">several witnesses</span>.

item:
    description: The property Item is any mention of specific physical objects, goods, or possessions that are owned, used, or associated with an individual or organization. This includes vehicles, tools, weapons, equipment, containers, personal belongings, and other tangible items that are uniquely identified or described in the text. The item must be specifically named or described with distinguishing characteristics (like brand, model, or specific features) rather than generic references. This feature does not include real estate, financial assets, or intangible property. It also excludes generic mentions of item categories without specific identification (e.g., "a car" would not qualify, but "a VW Beetle" would). It includes any mention of a drug or other illicit substance (common or chemical name) in the context of possession, trafficking, use, etc.
    example:
        - One of the applicant’s associates entered the shop, snatched a <span class="item">Securicor bag</span>.
        - Two vehicles (a <span class="Item">Peugeot 505</span> - mainly for the taxi traffic; and a <span class="item">seven-seater Citroën</span> - mainly for the interurban traffic) were used in the business.
        - During his arrest, the police found 23 grams of <span class="item">heroin</span>.

charges:
    description: The property Charges is any mention of criminal allegations, formal accusations, or specific offenses that an individual or organization has been charged with, arrested for, or convicted of by legal authorities. This includes both formal legal charges (such as robbery, assault, possession of weapons) and informal accusations of criminal conduct (such as being suspected of terrorism). The charges may be explicitly stated in legal terms or described in more general terms that clearly indicate criminal conduct. This feature encompasses both pending charges and those that have resulted in convictions, as well as the status of the accused. It does not include general references to criminal behavior without specific charges, or theoretical discussions of crimes. The charges can be mentioned in any stage of the legal process, from initial arrest through final conviction. Extract only when the offense is definitively attributed to a person or entity via charge-bearing language (e.g., “was charged with”, “was arrested for”, “was accused of”, “was convicted of”) or equivalent formulations indicating an actual allegation/charge; Extract only specific, nameable offenses (e.g., “false accounting”, “conspiracy to defraud”, “robbery under s.8 Theft Act 1968”) or clear statutory/process offenses when the text explicitly frames them as the offense of charge/conviction/arrest. Do not extract vague placeholders or meta-references like “offence/offences,” “specific offences,” “these offences,” “criminal matters,” or “charges”. Do not extract warnings, intentions, hypotheticals, or procedural steps that do not amount to an attributed allegation (e.g., “liable to prosecution”, “intended to institute proceedings”, “if he had pleaded guilty…”, “summoned to attend court”, “failure to provide information is an offence under s.172”).
    example:
        - The applicant alleged, in particular, that his tariff as a <span class="charges">discretionary life prisoner</span> had not been set at trial by a judge.
        - On 30 November 1988, the applicant was convicted at the Central Criminal Court in London of <span class="charges">wounding with intent</span>.
        - They were informed that they were being arrested under this section and that this was because the arresting officer suspected them of being <span class="charges">terrorists</span>.
        - The motive behind the kidnapping was believed to have been an attempt to force the young woman to retract an <span class="charges">allegation of rape</span> made the previous year as a result of which a person had been convicted.

Crime_Related_Circumstances:
    description: The property Crime-Related Circumstances of the category Criminal History refers to any mention of any specific details about the actions, events, physical interactions, or outcomes that occurred during the commission of a crime or during related events (such as arrests or escapes). This includes descriptions of physical injuries sustained by any party, specific body parts affected, details of physical restraints or force used, methods of attack or defense, and sequences of criminal actions. The circumstances must be specific and detailed rather than general descriptions. This feature does not include the basic crime classification, the location where the crime took place, or general descriptions of criminal behavior without specific details. It also excludes circumstances that occurred well before or after the criminal incident that are not directly related to the crime itself.
    example:
        - The applicant had not stopped, but had moved himself over to her seat and held her <span class="Crime_Related_Circumstances">arms behind the neck support</span>.
        - The police returned fire and one of the applicant’s associates was killed. The applicant received a <span class="Crime_Related_Circumstances">superficial wound to his shoulder</span>.
        - They were intercepted by the police, who surrounded them and told them to lay down their arms. The applicant fired six shots, wounding one <span class="Crime_Related_Circumstances">police officer in the leg</span>.

health:
    description: The property Health of the category Demographics refers to any explicit, referential mention of a person’s physical or mental health condition, including both temporary and permanent states that affect well-being. This encompasses direct descriptions of illness, injury, disability, symptoms, or other health-related impairments, whether medically diagnosed or expressed in general language (e.g., “back pain”, “numbness in his arm”, “mental distress”). The property applies only when the text linguistically denotes a health condition itself, not merely its social, financial, or employment consequences. Mentions of work status, leave, or benefits (e.g., “sick leave”, “disability pension”, “early retirement pension”) are excluded unless they include or directly co-refer to a specific health condition. The property includes references to loss or limitation of functional capacity due to health causes (e.g., “loss of working capacity”, “permanent disablement”) when the cause is explicitly health-related. It also includes contextual mentions when a condition is cited as a reason for an event, delay, or legal action. Exclude general references to healthcare systems, treatment facilities, or medical procedures unless a concrete condition is described, as well as hypothetical or non-referential statements about health. Exclude vague, non-specific terms (e.g., “problems”, “issues”, “condition”, “injuries”) when they do not explicitly denote or qualify a physical or mental health state, as these lack sufficient referential meaning to constitute identifiable health information.
    example:
        - He claimed that the defendant companies should be held liable to pay, jointly and severally, a specified amount in compensation for <span class="health">permanent disablement and loss of working capacity</span>.
        - On 12 November 1986 the applicant was involved in a car accident. He was <span class="health">severely injured</span> and is now <span class="health">partly disabled</span>.
        - Mrs Demirdaş requested the court to accept the case despite the expiry of the statutory time-limit on 17 September 2000, as she had had <span class="health">health problems</span> preventing her lodging the case earlier.
        - The Forensic Medicine Institute forwarded to the Tunceli Court a number of medical reports, confirming that Mrs Demirtaş had been <span class="health">ill</span> between 23 August 2000 and 17 September 2000.

age_number:
    description:  The property Age (number) of the subcategory Age of the category Demographics refers to any explicit or implicit reference to a person's age, including specific numbers (whether written as digits or spelled out), birth years, or age ranges. This includes both current and historical age references, as well as relative age indicators when paired with specific temporal markers. The property captures both standalone age mentions and those provided in context of life events or legal proceedings. It does not include general age-related terms (like "young," "elderly," or "middle-aged") unless accompanied by specific numerical values, nor does it include references to age groups or cohorts (such as "millennials" or "baby boomers") that don't specify individual ages.
    example:
        - At the time Ms A and the applicant had been <span class="age_number">seventeen</span> and <span class="age_number">twenty-three years</span> old, respectively. Together they had left a party at Mr C’s home in order to buy mineral water at the petrol station.

Nationality_Ethnicity: 
    description: The property Nationality_Ethnicity refers to any explicit mention of a person's national origin, citizenship status, or ethnic background. This includes both formal declarations of citizenship (e.g., “Indonesian national,” “Chinese citizen”) and adjectives describing nationality or ethnicity when applied to individuals (e.g., “Cuban,” “Mexican”). This property should be captured whether the nationality or ethnicity is mentioned as a primary identifier or as supplementary information about the person. The property applies to both singular references (referring to one person) and collective references (referring to multiple people who share the same nationality or ethnicity), as long as it refers to individuals rather than organizations or institutions. However, this property also extends to the nationality or geographic affiliation of organizations, companies, or collective entities when such adjectives explicitly denote their national identity or origin (e.g., “German manufacturer,” “Swedish company,” “French bank”). It thus covers references that ascribe national identity or affiliation to both persons and institutional actors when nationality functions as an identifying attribute rather than merely a geographical locator. This feature does not include references to the geographical location of organizations, governmental bodies, or institutions (e.g., “Cuban court,” “Mexican ministry,” “Haitian Human Rights group”), nor does it include mentions of where a person resides or works unless it explicitly states their nationality or ethnicity.
    example:
        - The applicant, Mr. Gunnar Bodén, was born in 1939. He is a <span class="Nationality_Ethnicity">Swedish citizen</span> resident in Falun and a car driver by profession.
        - The case originated in an application against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 by a <span class="Nationality_Ethnicity">United Kingdom</span> national, Mr Ronald Easterbrook on 13 April 1999.
        - The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir Vincent Evans, the elected judge of <span class="Nationality_Ethnicity">British nationality</span> and Mr R. Ryssdal.
        - The television programme was produced in Sweden by the <span class="Nationality_Ethnicity">Swedish</span> company Strix Television AB

duration:
    description: The property Duration of the category Datetime refers to any mention of a specific time period or time span, whether expressed as a single unit or a combination of time units (such as minutes, hours, days, months, or years). This includes durations related to sentences, work periods, illness progression, or any other temporal measurements explicitly stated in the text. The duration must be a clearly defined length of time, not just a date or point in time. The property captures both exact durations (like "ten hours") and composite durations (like "1 year and 2 months"). It encompasses durations that describe lengths of imprisonment, periods of illness, work hours, or any other measurable time spans associated with events, conditions, or activities. The duration should be a quantifiable period, meaning it must include both a numeric value (whether written as numbers or spelled out in words) and a time unit.
    example:
        - These included H.’s fees which amounted to SEK 10,395 for, inter alia, <span class="duration">ten hours</span> of work.
        - The main reason for the applicant’s inability to work was diabetes, from which he had suffered for <span class="duration">16 years</span> at the time of the accident.
        - By a judgment of 24 May 1994 the applicant was convicted on all the above-mentioned counts and sentenced to <span class="duration">1 year and 2 months</span> in prison.
    linked_to_individual: false
date:
    description: The property Date refers to any temporal reference that indicates a specific point or period in time, regardless of its format or level of precision. This includes exact calendar dates, seasons with years or years alone (which are considered a valid specific point in time for this property). The date can be expressed either in a numerical format, written out in words, or described through contextual references (such as references to historical events with clear temporal associations). Both singular dates, multi-date expressions, year numbers and date ranges should be captured, and each distinct date within a range should be recorded separately. But you should only extract the distinct date not the range, however, when the text lists multiple specific dates together, whether separated by “and”, commas, slashes, or an en dash, you should extracte the dates as one entry. The reference can be either a standalone temporal marker or embedded within a broader historical or personal context, such as birth dates, event dates, or administrative dates, but can't refer to a time period or time span, only to a specific point in time. The date must be explicitly stated in the text; implied dates or dates that require calculation or inference should not be included. Exclude years or numeric strings that form part of the official title of an instrument, organization, publication, case, model, or similar nominal identifier (e.g., “Prison Rules 1964”, “Expropriation Act 1972”), when they function as names rather than temporal references; do not extract the year from such titles even if it looks like a calendar year. Also exclude numeric identifiers embedded in legal or administrative document names (e.g., “Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen 1991:1469”, “Regulation (EU) 2016/679”, “Act No. 2005:123”), where the year forms part of a structured code or citation rather than denoting a date.
    example:
        - The applicant settled in Sweden in the <span class="date">second half of the 1980s</span>.
        - A daughter was born out of the relationship on <span class="date">16 October 1996</span>.
        - In <span class="date">1986</span> the applicant commenced his military training in Iran.
        - The meeting took place on the <span class="date">8 and 9 November 1993</span>.

realtive_time:
    description: The property Relative Time refers to any temporal expression that establishes a relationship between two points in time, rather than specifying an absolute date or time. This includes references to durations (e.g., "two weeks later," "after three months"), intervals relative to specific events (e.g., "within 72 hours of admission," "5 days before the incident"), and comparative time expressions (e.g., "earlier than," "prior to"). However, this property does not include absolute dates (e.g., "January 4, 2000"), fixed calendar references (e.g., "every Monday"), or general time-of-day expressions (e.g., "at noon") unless they are explicitly used to establish a relative relationship with another point in time. Short discourse connectors or vague markers like "then," "once," "at the time," or "subsequently," when used without a clear quantitative or event-based temporal relation, should **not** be extracted as relative times. Only extract expressions that explicitly establish a measurable or event-anchored temporal relationship. Exclude normative or qualitative legal standards that lack a measurable anchor, such as “within a reasonable time”, “without undue delay”, “promptly”, “as soon as practicable”, or “in due course”, unless they are immediately tied to a specific duration or event (e.g., “within 30 days”, “promptly after arrest”).
    example:
        - The applicant suffered a heart attack which caused him to fall. About <span class="realtive_time">two weeks later</span>, he also suffered a cerebral stroke.
        - A Special Report form dated 4 January 2000 (relating to detention beyond the <span class="realtive_time">seventy-second day</span> which would fall on 13 January 2000) also recorded that the applicant was likely to suborn witnesses.

named_location:
    description: The property Named Location of the category Location refers to any explicit mention of a geographic place with a proper name, including countries, cities, towns, counties, provinces, states, regions, neighborhoods, districts, or other recognized territorial designations. This category encompasses political, administrative, or naturally defined areas with officially recognized names. Short forms and acronyms of official country names (e.g., “United Kingdom” for “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland”; “UK”/“U.K.”; “United States”; “US”/“U.S.”; “UAE”; “DRC”) also fall under this category. Country names may appear with or without a leading article (e.g., “the United Kingdom”, “the Netherlands”, “the Gambia”). Named Locations may be mentioned as someone's birthplace, residence, travel destination, or location of events. This property excludes named facilities (like hospitals, schools, prisons), buildings, or specific addresses. Both current and historical place names are included, as well as references to locations regardless of their size or significance. The context should clearly indicate that the reference is to a geographic entity rather than an organization or institution that happens to share a name with a place.
    example:
        - The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in <span class="named_location">London</span>.
        - In 1999 he was serving as a gunner with the 12th Regiment of the Royal Artillery and was stationed in <span class="named_location">Germany</span>.

facility:
    description: The property Facility refers to any explicit mention of physical structures, buildings, or establishments where activities take place, whether they have formal names or are described generically. This includes prisons, detention centers, courts, police stations, military installations, hospitals, schools, government buildings, and other similar locations. A facility is distinguished from an organization by being a physical place rather than an administrative or institutional actor. When a location serves as the site of operations for an organization but is primarily referenced as a physical structure (like "Human Rights Building" vs. "Human Rights Commission"), it should be categorized as a facility. This category includes both civilian and military facilities, public and private buildings, and applies regardless of whether the person mentioned has visited, resided in, or is otherwise associated with the facility. Street addresses of facilities should be included when mentioned. Do not extract bare institutional or functional references where the entity is acting as a judicial, administrative, or corporate body rather than being described as a physical site (e.g., “the court adjourned the case”, “the High Court upheld the decision”). Such mentions refer to institutional authority, not to a physical facility. Similarly, exclude generic or jurisdictional court names (e.g., “City Court”, “High Court of Western Denmark”) when they appear in procedural or adjudicative contexts without any physical or locational qualifier (like “building”, “premises”, or address). Extract only when the mention is used referentially to denote a physical location, e.g., “the hearing took place at the High Court of Western Denmark building in Aarhus.”. 
    example:
        - The applicant was born in 1964 and is currently detained in <span class="linked_to_individual">HM Prison Brixton</span>.
        - The hearing was held in public at the <span class="linked_to_individual">Human Rights Building</span>, Strasbourg.

code:
    description: "The property Code is any reference to any alphanumeric identifiers or reference numbers associated with an individual or organization, including but not limited to: government-issued identification (social security numbers, passport numbers, national ID codes), financial identifiers (account numbers, credit card numbers, tax IDs), administrative references (case numbers, file references, application IDs), vehicle identifiers, telecommunication identifiers, and any sequence of numbers and/or letters that serves as a unique identifier in official, legal, financial, or administrative contexts. This includes codes that appear with prefixes or in standardized formats (such as no., ref., file nos.), as well as those presented in sequences or lists, but you must extract only the number not the prefixes or standardized formats The identifier must be specific enough to potentially enable identification of a particular individual or organization when combined with other information. You should not extract values like 'Category A' or '1 Category', as they represent categorization, but not a code. Exclude: (a) citations of legal instruments and provisions (e.g., 'Law no. 3953', 'Article 168 § 1/§ 2', 'Articles 102 and 104', 'Rule 59 § 1', '§ 3', 'Schedule 2'); (b) statute/article/paragraph/section numbers from penal/civil codes or court rules, even when numeric; (c) numeric quantities, dates, durations, page/paragraph numbers used for navigation; (d) category labels or classes (e.g., 'Category A', 'Group 1'); (e) generic numbering not tied to a specific person/organization (e.g., 'Form 12', 'Article 34 of the Convention'). The identifier must be specific enough that, when combined with context, it could identify a particular person, organization, or their record."
    example:
        - The applicants further initiated execution proceedings before the İslahiye Execution Office to obtain those amounts ordered by the İslahiye Civil Court of First Instance (file nos. <span class="code">2004/351</span< and <span class="code">2004/352</span>).

organization:
    description: The property organization refers to any explicit mention of an organization, be it either an organized body-public or private-including government departments, agencies, boards, tribunals, NGOs, corporations or other institutional entities. This category encompasses political, adminstratice or private organization. This propetery encompasses both the names of organization, such as "Friends of the Earth", "Macmillan Cancer Support", "British Red Cross", and any denotion of an organization, such as "High Court", "employment agency", "The immigration authorities", "the nigerian government". This property excludes named facilities (like hospitals, schools, prisons), buildings, country names or specific addresses and also the word "government" itself. Both current and historical organization are included. The context should clearly indicate that the reference is to an organization rather than an facility or location. Generic institutional nouns used anaphorically to refer to a specific organization mentioned in the nearby context (e.g., “the Council”, “the Ministry”, “the Home Office”) should be tagged as organization. Simple names for governmental bodies like "the public prosecutor", "the police", “the Court” should not be included. Exclude collective role or party descriptors without institutional status (e.g., “defendant companies”, “plaintiffs”, “management”) unless a specific organization name is expressed. Exclude internal subdivisions or formations that are not independently constituted institutions (e.g., “Second Chamber”, “Legal Department”) unless they are officially recognized as separate entities; “Chambers” of a court are generally procedural formations and not organizations. Include official company names containing legal or jurisdictional suffixes (e.g., “Ltd”, “PLC”, “Inc.”, “GmbH”, “SA”, “AB”, “LLC”) even when preceded by generic appositives like “the company” or “firm”, as these refer to identifiable organizational entities.

job_title:
    description: The property Job Title refers to any mention of a person's professional role, occupation, or position within an organization, whether it is a current or past position. This includes formal job titles in legal and governmental institutions and designations and operational roles within organizations. The job title can be either a permanent position or a temporary role, and it may be mentioned in both civilian and military contexts. It also includes functional or relational occupational roles commonly used in legal and everyday contexts even when not formal positions (e.g., landlord, tenant, employer, employee, caregiver, babysitter). This property should capture professional roles regardless of their seniority level, from entry-level positions to high-ranking official titles. However, it should not include purely familial or social relations (e.g., mother, son, friend), volunteer descriptors without a role, generic activity descriptions that are not occupations or the occupation "lawyer", as this is a legal text and therefore "lawyer" is not a PII. When the text mentions multiple roles for the same person, each distinct job title should be captured separately. Extract only explicit occupational titles that appear verbatim in the text (e.g., ‘Legal Counsellor’, ‘Barrister-at-Law’, ‘Solicitor’, ‘Adviser’)—do not infer or normalize; the identifier must be the exact text span. Exclude post-nominal ranks/qualifications and procedural designations (e.g., ‘Q.C.’/‘K.C.’, ‘LL.M.’, ‘Agent’, ‘Delegate’, generic ‘Counsel’) unless they are part of a longer formal job title. **Do not** extract generic institutional role mentions used narratively (e.g., “the judge noted...”, “the prosecutor submitted ...”, “the registrar stated...”). Titles combined with names or honorifics (e.g., “Judge Smith”, “Lord Justice Carswell”) **should** be extracted; generic role nouns alone (e.g., “judge”, “prosecutor”) **should not** be extracted. **Exclude** indefinite or generic function-holders (e.g., “a financial investigator”, “the investigating officer”, “Recorder”). **Exclude** indefinite or generic function-holders (e.g., “a financial investigator”, “the investigating officer”). Exclude titles appearing solely as part of statutory/process phrases (e.g., “requirement of the financial investigator”, “appointed under the ... Order”) or institutional capacities where no individual is specified.
