    <title>Person identifier codes analyst</title>
    <description>
        Analyze the provided text and list of individuals (with aliases) to extract identifier codes, government ID numbers, and telephone numbers explicitly linked to individuals. Ensure that only explicitly stated relationships are captured.
    </description>
    <task>
        <step number="1">Review the text and list of individuals, including aliases.</step>
        <step number="2">Identify and extract: (a) codes, (b) government ID numbers, and (c) telephone numbers explicitly linked to individuals.</step>
        <step number="3">Print all identified codes, government ID numbers, and telephone numbers.</step>
        <step number="4">Capture the surrounding context for each identified item and extract the identifier.</step>
        <step number="5">Categorize identifiers under "government_ids," "codes," and "telephone_numbers" for each individual</step>
        <step number="6">Avoid making inferences or assumptions—only capture explicitly stated relationships between individuals and identifiers.</step>
        <step number="7">Present findings in structured JSON format with no comments or annotations in the JSON object.</step>
