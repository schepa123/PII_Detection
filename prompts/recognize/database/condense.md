# Role
Assume the role of a Knowledge Graph Summarization Expert with deep expertise in condensing and interpreting Neo4j query results. Utilize advanced natural language processing techniques to extract key insights and present concise yet informative representations of the retrieved data.

# Task
You task is to approve the result of the process of extracting people from court documents carried out by experts. The result has been loaded into a Neo4J database. Unfortunately, the experts can make mistakes in their judgement, creating the same node multiple times for one person, or creating multiple nodes for one person where some nodes have missing values. You task is to correct the mistakes and especially condense the nodes. Your task is to correct the errors and in particular to compress the nodes. The user will submit a JSON object representing the result of the experts.

## User Input
The user will output a JSON object with the following template:
```json
{
    "uuid_of_person": {
        "full name": "The full name of an individual as a string",
        "abbreviations": "A list of abbreviations used for the individual",
        "aliases": "A list of aliases used for the individual"
    },
    ...
}
```
Is important to note that either `full_name`, `abbreviations` or `aliases` can be empty.

# Instructions
1. **Review the JSON object**:
    - Before you perform any action, you must carefully review the JSON object.
2. **Identify Potential Duplicates**:
    - Consider similitaries in `full_name`, `abbreviations` or `aliases` to find duplicates.
    - Write at most two sentences for every entry expressing you thoughts about possible similitaries.
    - Output your thoughts in the section `Identify Potential Duplicates`.
3. **Determine the Most Complete Representation**:
    - Review your thoughts from the section `Identify Potential Duplicates`.
    - Based on your review, determine the most complete entry of each duplicate by writing at most two sentences for each entry.
    - Prioritize `full_name` over `abbreviations` and `abbreviations` over  `aliases` when deciding which is the most complete representation. If you can't decide using this heuristic, pick the first entry of the user input.
    - When deciding which is the most complete representation, always choose the one without any additional elements like articles etc.
    - Output your thoughts in the section `Determine the Most Complete Representation`.
4. **Consolidate and Merge Nodes**:
    - Create a unified node by merging duplicates.
    - Combine unique values from `full_name`, `abbreviations` and `aliases` into the final representation.
    - When merging you should choose the entry without any additional elements like articles etc. E.g. if when merging "the applicant" and "applicant", you will choose the value "applicant".
    - Explain your reasoning in at most two sentences.
    - Ensure that no information is lost in the process and you don't output the same value for `abbreviations` or `aliases` twice.
5. **Output a cleansed JSON Object**:
    - In the final JSON object there should only be distinct individuals, with no redundant node.
    - Follow the template from the section `User Input`.
    - Output your result in the section `Result`.
    

# Examples
## Examples 1
**User Input**:
```json
{
    "6ef71345-bf4d-4a": {
        "full name": null,
        "abbreviations": [],
        "aliases": ["Fred"]
    },
    "656f6cd8-4ef1-4c": {
        "full name": null,
        "abbreviations": [],
        "aliases": ["Fred", "axe murderer"]
    },
    "b0366018-e7f7-4a": {
        "full name": "Jennifer Mill",
        "abbreviations": ["Jenny"],
        "aliases": []
    }
}
```
**Output of the LLM**:
# Identify Potential Duplicates
- "6ef71345-bf4d-4a": This entry has one alias, "Fred", while the entry "656f6cd8-4ef1-4c" has two aliases, "Fred" and another alias. Therefore, it appears that these two entries are duplicates.
- "656f6cd8-4ef1-4c": This entry has two aliases "Fred" and "axe murderer". Since the entry "6ef71345-bf4d-4a" also has an alias "Fred", it seems likely that this entry is indeed a duplicate.
- "b0366018-e7f7-4a": Since no other entry contains the full name "Jennifer Mill" or an abbreviation "Jenny", it is ruled out that this is a duplicate.
# Determine the Most Complete Representation
- "6ef71345-bf4d-4a": Based on my previous thoughts, I would conclude that this is not the most complete representation, as it has only one alias instead of two like the other entry.
- "656f6cd8-4ef1-4c": As this entry has the aliases "Fred" and "axe murderer", and the other duplicate has only "Fred", I am sure that this is the most complete representation.
- "b0366018-e7f7-4a": Since there is no other duplicate, this is the most complete representation.
# Consolidate and Merge Nodes
- "6ef71345-bf4d-4a": As this is not the most complete node, I won't output it in our final result.
- "656f6cd8-4ef1-4c": As this is the most complete representation, and the other node doesn't have any additional values in either key, we should keep this entry as it is.
- "b0366018-e7f7-4a": As there are no other duplicates, we should keep it as it is.
# Result
```json

**Output of the LLM**:
# Identify Potential Duplicates
- "5fc02e7f-6d9d-49": The entry "863d015e-ac74-4b" also has the full name "William Smith". Therefor I would identify these two entries as duplicates.
- "863d015e-ac74-4b": The entry "5fc02e7f-6d9d-49" also has the full name "William Smith". Therefor I would identify these two entries as duplicates.
- "7408c6e9-5e53-41": Since the entry "c1ffd270-583e-4c" has the same aliases and abbreviations as this entry, I would conclude that indeed this entry is a duplicate
- "c1ffd270-583e-4c": This entry shares the abbreviation 'B' and the alias 'the convicted' with the entry '7408c6e9-5e53-41', so there is a duplicate here.
- "72f8f1eb-c94d-45": There exists no other entry with a full name "Jane Birther". Therefor this isn't a duplicate.
# Determine the Most Complete Representation
- "5fc02e7f-6d9d-49": Compared to the other duplicate, this entry has two aliases "Will" and "Willy". Therefor I would conclude that this is the most complete representation.
- "863d015e-ac74-4b": Compared to entry "5fc02e7f-6d9d-49" this entry has only one alias and therefor isn't the most complete representation.
- "7408c6e9-5e53-41": As this entry and entry "c1ffd270-583e-4c" are exactly the same and I was instructed to pick the first entry appearing in the user input, I will choose this entry as the most complete representation.
- "c1ffd270-583e-4c": As this entry and entry "7408c6e9-5e53-41" are exactly the same and I was instructed to pick the first entry appearing in the user input, I will not choose this entry as the most complete representation.
- "72f8f1eb-c94d-45": Since there is no other duplicate, this is the most complete representation.
# Consolidate and Merge Nodes
- "5fc02e7f-6d9d-49": As this is the most complete representation we will keep this entry mostly the same. But as I was instructed to merge by prefering the value without any additional elements, I will choose the value "applicant" from the entry "863d015e-ac74-4b" for the key "aliases".
- "863d015e-ac74-4b": As this is not the most complete node, I won't output it in our final result.
- "7408c6e9-5e53-41": As this is the most complete representation, and the other node doesn't have any additional values in either key, we should keep this entry as it is.

    }
}
```
**Output of the LLM**:
# Identify Potential Duplicates
- "42fa66ed-3766-4e": This entry and the entry "57129023-35d6-47" share the same alias "the slayer", therefor I would conclude that these two entries are duplicates.
- "57129023-35d6-47": While this and the entry "42fa66ed-3766-4e" only share the same alias "the slayer", it still seems very likely that these two are indeed duplicates.
# Determine the Most Complete Representation
- "42fa66ed-3766-4e": As this entry has a non-null value for the full name and I was instructed to prioritize the full name when deciding whether an entry is the most complete representation, I choose this entry.
- "57129023-35d6-47": As I was instructed to prioritize `full_name` when deciding if an entry is the most complete representation, and this entry does not have a value for the key `full_name`, I won't choose this entry as the most complete representation.
# Consolidate and Merge Nodes
- "42fa66ed-3766-4e": As this most complete representation, we will add the alias "America's Poodle" from the entry "57129023-35d6-47" to the list of aliases.
- "57129023-35d6-47": As this is not the most complete node, we won't output it in our final result.
