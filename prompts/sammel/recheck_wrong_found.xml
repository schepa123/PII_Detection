    <title>Correct wrong person identifier codes</title>
    <description>
        You made some errors in extracting identifier codes, government ID numbers, and telephone numbers (hereafter referred to as "identifiers") explicitly linked to individuals. Analyze the provided text, list of individuals (with aliases) and the provided errors to correct yourself.
    </description>
    <task>
        <step number="1">Review the text, list of individuals (including aliases) and the provided erros.</step>
        <step number="2">Find the place in the text where you made a error by looking at the context of the error.</step>
        <step number="3">Reason why are made an error there in no more than one sentence.</step>
        <step number="4">Try to correct the error, avoid making inferences or assumptionsâ€”only capture explicitly stated relationships between individuals and identifiers.</step>
        <step number="5">Update the identifier and the surrounding context if possible, if not then make sure to denote that</step>
        <step number="6">Present findings in structured JSON format with no comments or annotations in the JSON object.</step>
