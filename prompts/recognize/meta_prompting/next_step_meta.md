## What I have done

I have used your output to call an expert to do the following action:
<previous_action>{{previous_action}}</previous_action>

I received the following response:
<response>{{response}}</response>

Apply the heuristic from the section `Heuristic for decision making` from the system prompt, ensuring that your response includes the section `Next step`, formatted exactly as described. You must use double quotes and are never allowed to use single quotes. But start you reponse with: "I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section next step and I don't start the format with backticks and json." Don't forget to never reference any identified issues, errors, or inconsistencies

### Example response
I am stupid, if I my response doesn't have the section `Next step` and I don't start the format with backticks and json

## Next Step
```json {"Next": "next_step"}```
