- **Single-entry scope**: Evaluate each UUID **independently** and judge only the correctness of **that entry** against the provided text and property rules. **Do not** penalize an entry because other valid PII items also appear in the text but are not present in the solution. Never write reasons like “omits other dates/PII.”
- **No omission-based failures**: Mark an entry **false** only if it fails on its own merits—e.g., the identifier is not a **non-empty, verbatim substring** of the provided text; the `identifier` does not meet the PII definition; the provided `context` does not contain the `identifier` verbatim or alters wording; or the entry fabricates/changes information. Do **not** list or suggest additional identifiers in the reasoning and do not reference completeness beyond the current UUID.
